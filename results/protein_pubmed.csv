The initial structure was generated by the artificial intelligence tool AlphaFold2 due to the current lack of experimental data. We focused on the hydrogen (H) bond of the odorant eugenol to Ser113, Asn207, and Tyr260 of the receptor protein, the importance of which has been suggested by previous experimental studies. The H-bond was not observed in docking simulations, but in subsequent MD simulations the H-bond to Ser113 was formed in 2-4 ns. The lifetime of the H-bond was in the range of 1-20 ns. On the trajectory with the most stable (20 ns) H-bond, the structural fluctuation of the α-carbon atoms of the receptor main chain was studied by calculating the root mean square fluctuations, the dynamic cross-correlation map, and the time-dependent dynamic cross-correlation. The analysis suggested a correlation transfer pathway Ser113 → Phe182 → (Leu259 or Tyr260) → Tyr291 induced by the ligand binding with a time scale of 4-6 ns.
Considering the harm of BHA on humans, thorough research of the effect of BHA on the structure of serum albumin is necessary. The binding mechanisms of BHA with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the effects of other three food additives (butylated hydroxytoluene, benzoic acid and citric acid) on BHA-BSA system were researched by multispectroscopy and molecular docking. The fluorescence quenching experiment results showed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of BSA by BHA was static quenching. The binding constant ((5.70 ± 0.38) × 103 M-1 at 298 K) and thermodynamic parameters (ΔH = 110.8 ± 2.91 kJ·mol-1 and ΔS = 443.3 ± 9.30 J·mol-1·K-1) indicated that BHA and BSA formed a relatively stable complex through hydrophobic interaction. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectra confirmed the conformation changes of BSA due to the binding of BHA. Site marker competitive experiments and molecular docking proved that BHA could bind BSA into site I in subdomain IIA. The results of molecular docking showed that BHA formed hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues (Ala290, Leu237, Leu259, Ile263 and Ile289). The presence of other food additives weakened the binding of BHA to BSA.
Coumarins exhibit many biological activities and are the main specialised metabolites of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn, an important plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. In preliminary studies, we cloned several genes involved in coumarin biosynthesis in P. praeruptorum, such as 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), p-coumaroyl CoA 2'-hydroxylase (C2'H), feruloyl CoA 6'-hydroxylase (F6'H) and bergaptol O-methyltransferase (BMT). However, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in P. praeruptorum (PpPAL) has not yet been studied. In the present study, we cloned one novel PpPAL gene. Subsequently, the relationship between gene and compounds was studied using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Then, enzyme function was analyzed with L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) as substrate. These experiments showed that the coumarin content could be upregulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), UV irradiation and cold, which was consistent with increased expression levels of PpPAL. In addition, correlation analysis indicated that coumarins were partially related to PpPAL. And the recombinant protein could catalyze the conversion of L-Phe to trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) with a Km of 120 ± 33 μM and a Kcat of 117 ± 32 min-1. Besides, Tyr110, Phe116, Gly117, Ser206, Leu209, Leu259, Tyr354, Arg357, Asn387 and Phe403 were essential for enzymatic activity based on three-dimensional modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Altogether these results highlight the importance of PpPAL in abiotically induced coumarin biosynthesis and provide further insights regarding the structure-function relationships of this protein.
Crystal structure of the protrusion domain (P-domain) of the grouper nervous necrosis virus (GNNV) shows the presence of three-fold trimeric protrusions with two asymmetrical calcium cations along the non-crystallographic three-fold axis. The trimeric interaction natures of the interacting residues and the calcium cations with the neighboring residues within the trimeric interface have been studied by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses in the framework of the density-functional theory (DFT) approach. The results revealed that residues Leu259, Val274, Trp280, and Gln322 of subunit A, Arg261, Asp275, Ala277, and Gln322 of subunit B, Leu259, Asp260, Arg261, Ala277, Val278, and Leu324 of subunit C are the main residues involved in the trimeric interactions. Charge-dipole, dipole-dipole, and hydrogen bonding interactions make the significant contributions to these trimeric interactions. Among different interacting residues within trimeric interface, residue pair Arg261 B-Leu259C forms the strongest hydrogen bond inside the interface between subunits B and C. It was also found that calcium cations interact with residues Asp273, Val274, and Asp275 of subunits A, B, and C through charge-charge and charge transfer interactions.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msl5 (branchpoint binding protein) orchestrates spliceosome assembly by binding the branchpoint sequence 5'-UACUAAC and establishing cross intron-bridging interactions with other components of the splicing machinery. Reciprocal tandem affinity purifications verify that Msl5 exists in vivo as a heterodimer with Mud2 and that the Msl5-Mud2 complex is associated with the U1 snRNP. By gauging the ability of mutants of Msl5 to complement msl5Δ, we find that the Mud2-binding (amino acids 35-54) and putative Prp40-binding (PPxY(100)) elements of the Msl5 N-terminal domain are inessential, as are the C-terminal proline-rich domain (amino acids 382-476) and two zinc-binding CxxCxxxxHxxxxC motifs (amino acids 273-286 and 299-312). A subset of conserved branchpoint RNA-binding amino acids in the central KH-QUA2 domain (amino acids 146-269) are essential pairwise (Ile198-Arg190; Leu256-Leu259) or in trios (Leu169-Arg172-Leu176), whereas other pairs of RNA-binding residues are dispensable. We used our collection of viable Msl5 mutants to interrogate synthetic genetic interactions, in cis between the inessential structural elements of the Msl5 polypeptide and in trans between Msl5 and yeast splicing factors (Mud2, Nam8 and Tgs1) that are optional for vegetative growth. The results suggest a network of important but functionally buffered protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions between the Mud2-Msl5 complex at the branchpoint and the U1 snRNP at the 5' splice site."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20235118/","Serine-arginine protein kinase-1 (SRPK1) is a highly specific kinase that recognizes serine-arginine dipeptide repeats and phosphorylates SR rich splicing factor ASF/SF2 in a cell-cycle regulated manner. SRPK1 processively phosphorylates serine residues on its substrate ASF/SF2. Elevated expression pattern of both SRPK1 and ASF/SF2 and their association with various carcinomas have established SRPK1 as a potent target for drug design against cancers. In order to develop specific inhibitors the binding of ASF/SF2 to SRPK1 is desired to be selectively interrupted. We have performed molecular dynamics simulation studies on crystal structure of SRPK1 complex with ASF/SF2. The ASF/SF2 acquired a stable binding on the surface of SRPK1 with strong attractive forces. Analysis revealed that there was no major position shifting of the core β-sheet region within the catalytic site of SRPK1 when present in the state of ASF/SF2 bound in comparison to apo form. Global motions of SRPK1 indicated that major stable structural changes occurred after the substrate binding. The interactions between SRPK1 and ASF/SF2 were examined and calculated during molecular dynamics simulation of 1 µs. Molecular dynamics study indicated Arg84, Lys85, Leu86, Lys174, Tyr227 and Leu479 residues of SRPK1 as essential hot spots involved in the stable binding with substrate. Structural analysis of the binding affinity and hot spot investigation provided significant information on ASF/SF2 binding which may also be considered for designing of the novel specific inhibitors of SRPK1 for the applications in cancer therapy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Anoxybacillus sp. WB42 pullulanase (PulWB42) is a novel thermophilic amylopullulanase that was assigned to the glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 14 (GH13_14) type I pullulanases in the carbohydrate-active enzymes database. Its N-terminal domain (Met1-Phe101) was identified as the carbohydrate-binding module 68 (CBM68) by homology modeling. The N-domain-deleted PulWB42 exhibited an equivalent Michaelis constant (Km ) for pullulan and significant decreases in pullulytic activity, amylose selectivity, and thermostability relative to PulWB42 having a high α-amylase-to-pullulanase activity ratio. Furthermore, the replacement of Ala90 or Arg93 significantly changed the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of PulWB42, whereas Q87A, L173D, and H5A/R6A/T7A showed improvements in thermostability and changes in catalytic kinetics. Therefore, the N domain of PulWB42 is not essential for catalysis, but it does modulate enzyme catalysis, especially with respect to substrate specificity. The modulation was achieved mainly by the Leu86-Arg93 segment adjacent to the CBM48 domain and the catalytic A domain in the modeled structure of PulWB42.
Human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT, SLC10A2) is responsible for intestinal reabsorption of bile acids and plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis. We used a targeted and systematic approach to delineate the role of highly conserved transmembrane helix 2 on the expression and function of hASBT. Cysteine mutation significantly depressed transport activity for >60% of mutants without affecting cell surface localization of the transporter. All mutants were inaccessible toward chemical modification by membrane-impermeant MTSET reagent, strongly suggesting that transmembrane 2 (TM2) plays an indirect role in bile acid substrate translocation. Both bile acid uptake and sodium dependence of TM2 mutants revealed a distinct α-helical periodicity. Kinetic studies with conservative and non-conservative mutants of sodium sensitive residues further underscored the importance of Gln(75), Phe(76), Met(79), Gly(83), Leu(86), Phe(90), and Asp(91) in hASBT function. Computational analysis indicated that Asp(91) may coordinate with sodium during the transport cycle. Combined, our data propose that a consortium of sodium-sensitive residues along with previously reported residues (Thr(134), Leu(138), and Thr(149)) from TM3 may form the sodium binding and translocation pathway. Notably, residues Gln(75), Met(79), Thr(82), and Leu(86) from TM2 are highly conserved in TM3 of a putative remote bacterial homologue (ASBTNM), suggesting a universal mechanism for the SLC10A transporter family.
Norovirus protease has been subjected to an extensive mutagenesis study. Ala-scanning mutation at 13 different positions (Trp6, Trp19, Thr27, Leu86, Leu95, Leu97, Met101, Gln117, Leu121, Thr134, Tyr143, Val144, and Val167) led to loss of function and/or stability. Considering the crystal structure of the protease, it was revealed that a hydroxyl group of Thr134 and an aromatic ring of Tyr143 were important for substrate recognition along with His157. It was notable that several of the residues identified were in close proximity to each other, suggesting their importance for the integrity and stability of the protease.
The NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) enzyme is a membrane-bound protein and contains both FAD and FMN cofactors. The enzyme transfers two electrons, one at a time, from NADPH to cytochrome P450 enzymes to function in the enzymatic reactions. We previously expressed in Escherichia coli the membrane-bound CYPOR (flAnCYPOR) from Anopheles minimus mosquito. We demonstrated the ability of flAnCYPOR to support the An. minimus CYP6AA3 enzyme activity in deltamethrin degradation in vitro. The present study revealed that the flAnCYPOR purified enzyme, analyzed by a fluorometric method, readily lost its flavin cofactors. When supplemented with exogenous flavin cofactors, the activity of flAnCYPOR-mediated cytochrome c reduction was increased. Mutant enzymes containing phenylalanine substitutions at leucine residues 86 and 219 were constructed and found to increase retention of FMN cofactor in the flAnCYPOR enzymes. Kinetic study by measuring cytochrome c-reducing activity indicated that the wild-type and mutant flAnCYPORs followed a non-classical two-site Ping-Pong mechanism, similar to rat CYPOR. The single mutant (L86F or L219F) and double mutant (L86F/L219F) flAnCYPOR enzymes, upon reconstitution with the An. minimus cytochrome P450 CYP6AA3 and a NADPH-regenerating system, increased CYP6AA3-mediated deltamethrin degradation compared to the wild-type flAnCYPOR enzyme. The increased enzyme activity could illustrate a more efficient electron transfer of AnCYPOR to CYP6AA3 cytochrome P450 enzyme. Addition of extra flavin cofactors could increase CYP6AA3-mediated activity supported by wild-type and mutant flAnCYPOR enzymes. Thus, both leucine to phenylalanine substitutions are essential for flAnCYPOR enzyme in supporting CYP6AA3-mediated metabolism."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14523560/","Chromosomal replication is initiated from the replication origin oriC in Escherichia coli by the active ATP-bound form of DnaA protein. The regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA) system, a complex of the ADP-bound Hda and the DNA-loaded replicase clamp, represses extra initiations by facilitating DnaA-bound ATP hydrolysis, yielding the inactive ADP-bound form of DnaA. However, the mechanisms involved in promoting the DnaA-Hda interaction have not been determined except for the involvement of an interaction between the AAA+ domains of the two. This study revealed that DnaA Leu-422 and Pro-423 residues within DnaA domain IV, including a typical DNA-binding HTH motif, are specifically required for RIDA-dependent ATP hydrolysis in vitro and that these residues support efficient interaction with the DNA-loaded clamp·Hda complex and with Hda in vitro. Consistently, substitutions of these residues caused accumulation of ATP-bound DnaA in vivo and oriC-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Leu-422 plays a more important role in these activities than Pro-423. By contrast, neither of these residues is crucial for DNA replication from oriC, although they are highly conserved in DnaA orthologues. Structural analysis of a DnaA·Hda complex model suggested that these residues make contact with residues in the vicinity of the Hda AAA+ sensor I that participates in formation of a nucleotide-interacting surface. Together, the results show that functional DnaA-Hda interactions require a second interaction site within DnaA domain IV in addition to the AAA+ domain and suggest that these interactions are crucial for the formation of RIDA complexes that are active for DnaA-ATP hydrolysis.
14-3-3 proteins belong to a family of conserved molecules expressed in all eukaryotic cells that play an important role in a multitude of signalling pathways. 14-3-3 proteins bind either to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues or to sequence-specific non-phosphorylated motifs in more than 200 interaction partners [Pozuelo Rubio, Geraghty, Wong, Wood, Campbell, Morrice and Mackintosh (2004) Biochem. J. 379, 395-408]. These interactions result in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, stress responses, cell metabolism and malignant transformation. One example of a phosphorylation-independent interaction is the binding of 14-3-3 to ExoS (exoenzyme S), a bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the present study, we have utilized additional biochemical and infection analyses to define further the structural basis of the interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3. An ExoS leucine-substitution mutant dramatically reduced the interaction potential with 14-3-3 suggesting that Leu422, Leu423, Leu426 and Leu428 of ExoS are important for its interaction with 14-3-3, its enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. However, ExoS substitution mutants of residues that interact with 14-3-3 through an electrostatic interaction, such as Ser416, His418, Asp424 and Asp427, showed no reduction in their interaction potential with 14-3-3. These ExoS substitution mutants were also as aggressive as wild-type ExoS at inducing cell death and to modify endogenous ExoS target within the cell. In conclusion, electrostatic interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3 via polar residues (Ser416, His418, Asp424 and Asp427) appears to be of secondary importance. Thus the interaction between the 'roof' of the groove of 14-3-3 and ExoS relies more on hydrophobic interaction forces, which probably contributes to induce cell death after ExoS infection and activation.
DnaA protein binds specifically to a group of binding sites called DnaA boxes within the bacterial replication origin to induce local unwinding of duplex DNA. DnaA domain IV comprises 94 amino acid residues and is required for DNA binding. At first, the backbone assignments of DnaA domain IV in the complexes were determined using several nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Using NMR analysis, we investigated the interaction between DnaA domain IV and DnaA box R1. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of DnaA domain IV showed prominent chemical shift perturbations on six residues (Arg399, Ala404, Leu422, Asp433, Thr435 and Thr436). Through homology modeling, we located all of these residues on one side of the surface of the DnaA domain IV molecule. Moreover, we confirmed that these residues in DnaA domain IV bind to DnaA box R1 by mutation analysis. Finally, we compared the chemical shift perturbation of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum in the presence of the DnaA box with that in the presence of a non-specific oligonucleotide that has a reduced affinity for DnaA, and the results suggested that Leu422 imparts specificity in binding with DnaA box R1.

To date, the structural basis for CYP1A2's preference to the planar substrates remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure-activity relationships for pig CYP1A2 catalyzing AFB1 and 7-ethoxyresorufin (7-ER). A molecular docking study was performed based on a constructed model of pig CYP1A2, which predicted the contributions of Thr-118, Thr-124, Phe-125, Phe-226, Leu-260, and Asp-313 to the substrate catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses exhibited the common grounds: Phe-125, Phe-226 and Asp-313 were vital to AFB1 oxidation (including exo-epoxidation and 9A-hydroxylation) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation. Meanwhile, Phe-125 and Phe-226 formed CH/π interactions with AFB1/7-ER, and Asp-313 formed hydrogen bonds with them. Based on other published reports, this study further emphasizes the critical roles of Phe-125 and Phe-226 in recognizing the planar substrates. Our findings highlight the structural basis of pig CYP1A2 specifically catalyzing AFB1 and 7-ER, and may help to elucidate the underlying mechanism of CYP1A2's metabolic preference to the planar and aromatic substrates.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) signaling has been shown to have antipsychotic properties in animal models and to impact glucose-dependent insulin release, satiety, memory, and learning in man. Previous work has shown that two coding mutations (rs6923761 and rs1042044) are associated with altered insulin release and cortisol levels. We identified four frequently occurring haplotypes in Caucasians, haplotype 1 through haplotype 4, spanning exons 4-7 and containing the two coding variants. We analyzed response to antipsychotics, defined as predicted change in PANSS-Total (dPANSS) at 18 months, in Caucasian subjects from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness treated with olanzapine (n=139), perphenazine (n=78), quetiapine (n=14), risperidone (n=143), and ziprasidone (n=90). Haplotype trend regression analysis revealed significant associations with dPANSS for olanzapine (best p=0.002), perphenazine (best p=0.01), quetiapine (best p=0.008), risperidone (best p=0.02), and ziprasidone (best p=0.007). We also evaluated genetic models for the two most common haplotypes. Haplotype 1 (uniquely including the rs1042044 [Leu(260)] allele) was associated with better response to olanzapine (p=0.002), and risperidone (p=0.006), and worse response to perphenazine (p=.03), and ziprasidone (p=0.003), with a recessive genetic model providing the best fit. Haplotype 2 (uniquely including the rs6923761 [Ser(168)] allele) was associated with better response to perphenazine (p=0.001) and worse response to olanzapine (p=.02), with a dominant genetic model providing the best fit. However, GLP1R haplotypes were not associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. These results link functional genetic variants in GLP1R to antipsychotic response.
We previously demonstrated that streptokinase (SK) can be used to generate active site-labeled fluorescent analogs of plasminogen (Pg) by virtue of its nonproteolytic activation of the zymogen. The method is versatile and allows stoichiometric and active site-specific incorporation of any one of many molecular probes. The limitation of the labeling approach is that it is both time-consuming and low yield. Here we demonstrate an improved method for the preparation of labeled Pg analogs by the use of an engineered SK mutant fusion protein with both COOH- and NH(2)-terminal His(6) tags. The NH(2)-terminal tag is followed by a tobacco etch virus proteinase cleavage site to ensure that the SK Ile(1) residue, essential for conformational activation of Pg, is preserved. The SK COOH-terminal Lys(414) residue and residues Arg253-Leu260 in the SK β-domain were deleted to prevent cleavage by plasmin (Pm) and to disable Pg substrate binding to the SK·Pg(∗)/Pm catalytic complexes, respectively. Near elimination of Pm generation with the SKΔ(R253-L260)ΔK414-His(6) mutant increased the yield of labeled Pg 2.6-fold and reduced the time required more than 2-fold. The versatility of the labeling method was extended to the application of Pg labeled with a near-infrared probe to quantitate Pg receptors on immune cells by flow cytometry.
A 2.0 ns unrestrained Molecular Dynamics was used to elucidate the geometric and dynamic properties of the HSA binding sites. The structure is not stress affected and the rmsds calculated from the published crystallographic data are almost constant for all the simulation time, with an averaged value of 2.4A. The major variability is in the C-terminus region. The trajectory analysis of the IIA binding site put in evidence fast oscillations for the Cgamma@Leu203...Cgamma@Leu275 and Cgamma@Leu219...Cgamma@Leu260 distances, with fluctuations around 250 ps, 1000 ps and over for the first, while the second is smoothly increasing with the simulation time from 7 to 10A. These variations are consistent with a volume increase up to 20% confirmed by the inter-domain contacts analysis, in particular for the pair O@Pro148...Ogamma@Ser283, representing the change of distance between IB-h9 and IIA-h6, O@Glu149...Ogamma@Ser189 for sub-domains IB-h9/IIA-h1 and N@Val339...Odelta2@Asp447 sub-domains IIB-h9/IIIA-h1. These inter-domain motions confirm the flexibility of the unfatted HSA with possible binding site pre-formation.
Amino acid sequence alignment was used to identify the putative thumb subdomain of reverse transcriptase (RT) from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Ty3. The counterpart to helix alphaH of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT, which mediates important interactions with a duplex nucleic acid approximately 3-6 bp behind the DNA polymerase catalytic center, was identified between amino acids 290 and 298 of the Ty3 enzyme. The consequences of substituting Ty3 RT Gln290, Phe292, Gly294, Asn297, and Tyr298 (the counterparts of HIV-1 RT Gln258, Leu260, Gly262, Asn265, and Trp266, respectively) for both DNA polymerase and RNase H activities were examined. DNA-dependent DNA synthesis was evaluated on unmodified substrates and on duplexes containing targeted insertion of locked nucleic acid analogs and abasic lesions in either the template or primer. Based on this combined strategy, our data suggest an interaction of Ty3 RT Tyr298 with primer nucleotide -3, Gly294 with primer nucleotide -4, and Asn297 with template nucleotide -6. Substitution of Ala for Gln290 was well tolerated, despite the high degree of conservation at this position. Mutations in the thumb subdomain of Ty3 also affected RNase H activity, suggesting a closer spatial relationship between its N- and C-terminal catalytic centers compared with HIV-1 RT."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8163498/","Tripartite motif (TRIM)7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that was first identified through its interaction with glycogenin-1 (GN1), the autoglucosyltransferase that initiates glycogen biosynthesis. A growing body of evidence indicates that TRIM7 plays an important role in cancer development, viral pathogenesis, and atherosclerosis and, thus, represents a potential therapeutic target. TRIM family proteins share a multidomain architecture with a conserved N-terminal TRIM and a variable C-terminal domain. Human TRIM7 contains the canonical TRIM motif and a B30.2 domain at the C terminus. To contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of TRIM7, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of its B30.2 domain (TRIM7B30.2) in two crystal forms at resolutions of 1.6 Å and 1.8 Å. TRIM7B30.2 exhibits the typical B30.2 domain fold, consisting of two antiparallel β-sheets of seven and six strands, arranged as a distorted β-sandwich. Furthermore, two long loops partially cover the concave face of the β-sandwich defined by the β-sheet of six strands, thus forming a positively charged cavity. We used sequence conservation and mutational analyses to provide evidence of a putative binding interface for GN1. These studies showed that Leu423, Ser499, and Cys501 of TRIM7B30.2 and the C-terminal 33 amino acids of GN1 are critical for this binding interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations also revealed that hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions play a major role in the stability of a modeled TRIM7B30.2-GN1 C-terminal peptide complex. These data provide useful information that could be used to target this interaction for the development of potential therapeutic agents.
14-3-3 proteins belong to a family of conserved molecules expressed in all eukaryotic cells that play an important role in a multitude of signalling pathways. 14-3-3 proteins bind either to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues or to sequence-specific non-phosphorylated motifs in more than 200 interaction partners [Pozuelo Rubio, Geraghty, Wong, Wood, Campbell, Morrice and Mackintosh (2004) Biochem. J. 379, 395-408]. These interactions result in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, stress responses, cell metabolism and malignant transformation. One example of a phosphorylation-independent interaction is the binding of 14-3-3 to ExoS (exoenzyme S), a bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the present study, we have utilized additional biochemical and infection analyses to define further the structural basis of the interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3. An ExoS leucine-substitution mutant dramatically reduced the interaction potential with 14-3-3 suggesting that Leu422, Leu423, Leu426 and Leu428 of ExoS are important for its interaction with 14-3-3, its enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. However, ExoS substitution mutants of residues that interact with 14-3-3 through an electrostatic interaction, such as Ser416, His418, Asp424 and Asp427, showed no reduction in their interaction potential with 14-3-3. These ExoS substitution mutants were also as aggressive as wild-type ExoS at inducing cell death and to modify endogenous ExoS target within the cell. In conclusion, electrostatic interaction between ExoS and 14-3-3 via polar residues (Ser416, His418, Asp424 and Asp427) appears to be of secondary importance. Thus the interaction between the 'roof' of the groove of 14-3-3 and ExoS relies more on hydrophobic interaction forces, which probably contributes to induce cell death after ExoS infection and activation.
This study describes the mechanism of homodimer formation of the 90-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP90). In eukaryotic cells, there are two HSP90 isoforms, alpha and beta, encoded by two separate genes. HSP90 alpha exists predominantly as a homodimer, HSP90 beta mainly as a monomer. Analysis by native PAGE revealed that bacterially expressed HSP90 alpha fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) existed as a high-molecular-mass oligomer, and was converted to a homodimer following removal of the fusion enzyme by thrombin cleavage. A deletion mutant, HSP90 alpha D44-603, formed a monomer and an N-terminal truncated mutant, HSP90 alpha 533-732, existed as a dimer, indicating that the dimer-forming ability resides somewhere in the C-terminal 200 amino acids. Limited proteolysis of the C-terminal 200 amino acids of HSP90 alpha with chymotrypsin produced the C-terminal 16-kDa fragment (Met628/Ala629-Asp732) and its adjacent more N-terminal 13-kDa fragment (Val542-Tyr627/Met628). Size-exclusion HPLC and two-dimensional PAGE analyses demonstrated that these two chymotryptic fragments bound each other. The C-terminal 198 amino acids as well as the full-length form of HSP90 beta revealed a lower dimer-forming activity than HSP90 alpha. Expression of the chimeric proteins at the C-terminal 198 amino acids of the alpha and beta isoforms further indicated that the 16 amino acid substitutions locating between amino acids 561 and 685 account for the impeded dimerization of HSP90 beta. A leucine zipper motif (Met402-Leu423) was unlikely to be involved in the dimer formation. Taken together, these results indicate that the dimeric structure of HSP90 alpha is mediated by the C-terminal 191 amino acids and consists of duplicate interactions of the C-terminal region (Met628/Ala629-Asp732) of one subunit and the adjacent more N-terminal region (Val542-Try627/Met628) of the other subunit.
Rat adipocyte cGMP-inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase (cGI-PDE) appears to be dually regulated in intact cells by serine phosphorylations induced by isoprenaline and insulin, respectively (Degerman, E., Smith, C. J., Tornqvist, H., Vasta, V., Belfrage, P., and Manganiello, V. C. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 533-537; Smith, C. J., Vasta, V., Degerman, E., Belfrage, P., and Manganiello, V. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13385-13390). Since cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) catalyzes the beta-adrenergic effects, the site in the isolated cGI-PDE phosphorylated by this kinase was explored. A peptide, LRRSSGASGLLTSEHHSR (P18), corresponding to the amino acid sequence Leu423-Arg440 in the putative regulatory domain of the rat adipocyte cGI-PDE was synthesized. It contains a consensus substrate sequence -RRXS- for cAMP-PK within two tryptic cleavage sites and was readily phosphorylated by cAMP-PK. Two phosphopeptides, identified as RS-[32P]SGASGLLTSEHHSR and S-[32P]SGASGLLTSEHHSR, were obtained after stoichiometric phosphorylation and trypsinization of the peptide. These two peptides and the two main tryptic phosphopeptides obtained from immunoisolated [32P]cGI-PDE phosphorylated with cAMP-PK in a solubilized crude adipocyte membrane fraction were immuno-precipitated by an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against P18 and exhibited the same chromatographic and electrophoretic profiles in three different separation systems. Similar radiosequencing profiles indicated that the second most N-terminal serine, corresponding to Ser-427 in the intact cGI-PDE, was phosphorylated by cAMP-PK in both P18 and authentic cGI-PDE. It is concluded that serine 427 is the target for cAMP-PK phosphorylation of the rat adipocyte cGI-PDE in vitro."

Serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, capable of binding with herbicide and pesticide residues. This study reports multifaceted approaches for in-depth and robust investigation of the molecular interactions of selected pesticides, including propanil (PPL), bromoxynil (BXL), metolachlor (MLR) and glyphosate (GPE) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteins using experimental (Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, native mass spectrometry and high field 1H NMR), molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and principal component analysis (PCA). The binding of pesticides with BSA resulted in BSA amide I and amide II Raman spectral shifts. PCA of Raman spectra of serum-pesticide complexes showed the grouping of pesticides on the score plot based on the similarities and differences in pesticides' chemical structures. Native mass spectrometry results revealed strong adduct formation of the pesticides with the protein. The observed changes in chemical shifts, peak broadening or peak disappearance of characteristic proton signals of the pesticides, indicated altered chemical environments due to binding BSA-pesticides interactions. The results of MD simulation conducted for over 500 ns revealed strong pesticides interaction with LEU197, LEU218, LEU237, TRP213, SER286 and ILE289 residues to the site I of BSA. Free energy landscapes provided insights into the conformational changes in BSA on the binding of pesticides. Overall, the experimental and computational results are in consonant and indicate the binding of pesticides into the site I and site II (sub-domain IIA) of the BSA via hydrogen bonding, non-covalent and hydrophobic interactions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aberrant level of the carbonic anhydrase isozymes is linked with various disorders which include glaucoma, epilepsy, altitude sickness and obesity. In the present study, a series of the pyrazole-based benzene sulfonamides derivatives (4a-4l) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as the inhibitors of the three isoforms of human carbonic anhydrases (hCAII, hCAIX and hCAXII). A number of the derivatives were found more active inhibitors than acetazolamide used as a standard against the human hCAII, hCAIX and hCAXII. Among the series, the compound 4k inhibited the hCAII to a submicromolar level presenting the IC50 ± SEM concentration of 0.24 ± 0.18 μM, the inhibitor 4j reduced the activity of the hCAIX to the IC50 ± SEM equals 0.15 ± 0.07 μM, whereas, the molecule 4g blocked the catalytic potential of the isozyme hCAXII with as low as IC50 concentration of 0.12 ± 0.07 μM. In addition, compounds 4e and 4k were screened as the preferential inhibitors of the isoform hCAXII as compared to the hCAIX and hCAXII with half of the maximal concentrations of 0.75 ± 0.13 μM, and 0.24 ± 0.18 μM, respectively. Moreover, the compounds 4k, 4j and 4g were docked inside the active pocket of the crystallographic structure of the isoforms hCAXII, hCAIX and hCAXII, respectively. The docked inhibitors showed the binding interactions with the important amino acid residues such as Leu1198, Thr1199, His1094, and Phe1131 in hCAXII isozyme; residues Val121, Thr200, Pro203, and Gln71 in hCAIX; the amino acids Val119, Leu197, Gln89, and Asn64 in the case of hCAXII. In addition, structural geometries, reactivity descriptors, optimization energy and electronic parameters were calculated to predict the activity of the synthesized compounds.
Annual ryegrass species (Lolium spp.) infest cereal crops worldwide. Ryegrass populations with multiple resistance to the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors are an increasing problem in several European countries. We investigated the resistance pattern and level of resistance in ryegrass populations collected in Denmark, Greece and Italy and studied the diversity of mechanisms endowing resistance, both target-site and metabolism based. All populations showed high resistance indexes (RI) to the ALS inhibitors, iodosufuron-methyl-sodium + mesosulfuron-methyl (RI from 8 to 70), whereas the responses to the two ACCase inhibitors, clodinafop-propargyl and pinoxaden, differed. The Greek and Italian populations were moderately to highly resistant to clodinafop (RI > 8) and showed low to moderate resistance to pinoxaden (RI ranged from 3 to 13) except for one Italian population. In contrast, the Danish Lolium populations showed low to moderate resistance to clodinafop (RI ranged from 2 to 7) and only one population was resistant to pinoxaden. Different mutant ACCase alleles (Leu1781, Cys2027, Asn2041, Val2041, Gly2078, Arg2088, Ala2096) and ALS alleles (Gly122, Ala197, Gln197, Leu197, Ser197, Thr197, Val205, Asn376, Glu376, Leu574) endowing resistance were detected in the Greek and Italian populations. In several plants, no mutated ALS and ACCase alleles were found showing a great heterogeneity within and among the Greek and Italian populations. Conversely, no mutant ACCase alleles were identified in the four Danish populations and only one mutant ALS allele (Leu574) was detected in two Danish populations. The expression level of nitronate monooxygenase (NMO), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and cytochrome P450s (CYP72A1 and CYP72A2) varied broadly among populations and individual plants within the populations. Constitutive up-regulation of GST, CYP72A1 and CYP72A2 was detected in resistant plants respect to susceptible plants in one Danish and one Italian population. It appears that the mechanisms underlying resistance are rather complex and diversified among Lolium spp. populations from the three countries, coevolution of both target-site resistance and metabolic based herbicide resistance appears to be a common feature in Denmark and Italy. This must be considered and carefully evaluated in adopting resistance management strategies to control Lolium spp. in cereal crops.
Target-site and non-target-site resistance mechanisms to ALS inhibitors were investigated in multiple resistant (tribenuron-methyl and 2,4-D) and only 2,4-D resistant, Spanish corn poppy populations. Six amino-acid replacements at the Pro197 position (Ala197, Arg197, His197, Leu197, Thr197 and Ser197) were found in three multiple resistant populations. These replacements were responsible for the high tribenuron-methyl resistance response, and some of them, especially Thr197 and Ser197, elucidated the cross-resistant pattern for imazamox and florasulam, respectively. Mutations outside of the conserved regions of the ALS gene (Gly427 and Leu648) were identified, but not related to resistance response. Higher mobility of labeled tribenuron-methyl in plants with multiple resistance was, however, similar to plants with only 2,4-D resistance, indicating the presence of non-target-site resistance mechanisms (NTSR). Metabolism studies confirmed the presence of a hydroxy imazamox metabolite in one of the populations. Lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype in plants treated with florasulam or imazamox, non-mutated plants surviving imazamox, tribenuron-methyl translocation patterns and the presence of enhanced metabolism revealed signs of the presence of NTSR mechanisms to ALS inhibitors in this species. On this basis, selection pressure with ALS non-SU inhibitors bears the risk of promoting the evolution of NTSR mechanisms in corn poppy.
Vespid phospholipase A1 (vPLA1) from the black-bellied hornet (Vespa basalis) catalyzes the hydrolysis of emulsified phospholipids and shows potent hemolytic activity that is responsible for its lethal effect. To investigate the mechanism of vPLA1 towards its function such as hemolysis and emulsification, we isolated vPLA1 from V. basalis venom and determined its crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution. vPLA1 belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family. It contains a tightly packed β-sheet surrounded by ten α-helices and a Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif, characteristic of a serine hydrolyase active site. A bound phospholipid was modeled into the active site adjacent to the catalytic Ser-His-Asp triad indicating that Gln95 is located at hydrogen-bonding distance from the substrate's phosphate group. Moreover, a hydrophobic surface comprised by the side chains of Phe53, Phe62, Met91, Tyr99, Leu197, Ala167 and Pro169 may serve as the acyl chain-binding site. vPLA1 shows global similarity to the N-terminal domain of human pancreatic lipase (HPL), but with some local differences. The lid domain and the β9 loop responsible for substrate selectivity in vPLA1 are shorter than in HPL. Thus, solvent-exposed hydrophilic residues can easily accommodate the polar head groups of phospholipids, thereby accounting for the high activity level of vPLA1. Our result provides a potential explanation for the ability of vPLA1 to hydrolyze phospholipids of cell membrane."

Hepatitis B viral load rapidly became undetectable in 6/7 patients. It remained below the level of detection in 2 subjects, after 20 and 22 months of treatment, with one of them achieving HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion. However, in the other 4 individuals, hepatitis B viremia increased again after 8 to 16 months of lamivudine-containing regimen. The last patient was a non-responder. The 4 relapsers developed a double mutation Leu(528) for Met(528) and Met(552) for Val(552), on hepatitis B virus polymerase, either concomitant (M8 and M16) with a hepatitis B virus DNA increase, or 2 months earlier (M10 and M12).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10933781/","Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key therapeutic target for combating hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. ACE inhibitory peptides offer the prospect of enhanced potency, high specificity, and no or low side effect. The ACE inhibitory tripeptides LKP and IKP differ from each other by one amino acid but their inhibitory potencies for ACE differ significantly. To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we have investigated the tripeptide/ACE complexes through molecular dynamics simulations coupled with quantum mechanical simulations. Comparative structural analysis has identified a hydrophobic subsite in the active site of cACE comprising hydrophobic residues Val379, Val380, Phe457, Phe527, and Ala418. The interactions of the side chains of Leu and Ile with the hydrophobic residues determine the binding positions of N-terminal residues of the tripeptides, that influence the interaction of the residues of tripeptides with the active site of cACE. This work presents the molecular mechanism of the interactions between the inhibitory tripeptides and ACE, and deciphers the structural basis for the high affinity LKP inhibition of ACE.
There is increasing evidence that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is associated with cardiovascular disease. However, it is still unclear whether LpPLA2 is simply a marker or has a causal role as either a pro- or anti-atherogenic factor.
Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and thyroxin binding globulin (TBG) both belong to the same SERPIN superfamily of serine-proteinase inhibitors but in the course of evolution CBG has adapted to its new role as a transport agent of insoluble hormones. CBG binds corticosteroids in plasma, delivering them to sites of inflammation to modify the inflammatory response. CBG is an effective drug carrier for genetic manipulation, and hence there is immense biological interest in the location of the hormone binding site. The crystal structure of human CBG (hCBG) has not been determined, but sequence alignment with other SERPINs suggests that it conforms as a whole to the tertiary structure shared by the superfamily. Human CBG shares 52.15% and 55.50% sequence similarity with alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment among the three sequences shows 73 conserved regions. The molecular structures of alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin, the archetype of the SERPIN superfamily, obtained by X-ray diffraction methods are used to develop a homology model of hCBG. Energy minimization was applied to the model to refine the structure further. The homology model of hCBG contains 371 residues (His13 to Val383 ). The secondary structure comprises 11 helices, 15 turns and 11 sheets. The putative corticosteroid binding region is found to exist in a pocket between beta-sheets S4, S10, S11 and alpha helix H10. Both cortisol and aldosterone are docked to the elongated hydrophobic ligand binding pocket with the polar residues at the two extremities. A difference accessible surface area (DASA) study revealed that cortisol binds with the native hCBG more tightly than aldosterone. Cleavage at the Val379-Met380 peptide bond causes a deformation of hCBG (also revealed through a DASA study). This deformation could probably trigger the release of the bound hormone. Figure Stereoscopic view of the ribbon diagram of hCBG complexed with cortisol. The bound cortisol is shown in space filling model in blue. Helices and sheets are shown in red and magenta respectively. Turns are shown in yellow.

The catalytic domains of the pterin-dependent enzymes phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase are homologous, yet differ in their substrate specificities. To probe the structural basis for the differences in specificity, seven residues in the active site of phenylalanine hydroxylase whose side chains are dissimilar in the two enzymes were mutated to the corresponding residues in tyrosine hydroxylase. Analysis of the effects of the mutations on the isolated catalytic domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase identified three residues that contribute to the ability to hydroxylate tyrosine, His264, Tyr277, and Val379. These mutations were incorporated into full-length phenylalanine hydroxylase and the complementary mutations into tyrosine hydroxylase. The steady-state kinetic parameters of the mutated enzymes showed that the identity of the residue in tyrosine hydroxylase at the position corresponding to position 379 of phenylalanine hydroxylase is critical for dihydroxyphenylalanine formation. The relative specificity of tyrosine hydroxylase for phenylalanine versus tyrosine, as measured by the (V/K(phe))/(V/K(tyr)) value, increased by 80000-fold in the D425V enzyme. However, mutation of the corresponding valine 379 of phenylalanine hydroxylase to aspartate was not sufficient to allow phenylalanine hydroxylase to form dihydroxyphenylalanine at rates comparable to that of tyrosine hydroxylase. The double mutant V379D/H264Q PheH was the most active at tyrosine hydroxylation, showing a 3000-fold decrease in the (V/K(phe))/(V/K(tyr)) value."

It would not be wrong to assume that travel and migration would be responsible for the spread of T. mentagrophytes Type VIII from India, with many strains resistant to terbinafine, to other parts of the world. From September 2016 until March 2020, a total of 29 strains of T. mentagrophytes Type VIII (India) were isolated. All patients were residents of Germany: 12 females, 15 males and the gender of the remaining two was not assignable. Patients originated from India (11), Pakistan (two), Bangladesh (one), Iraq (two), Bahrain (one), Libya (one) and other unspecified countries (10). At least two patients were German-born residents. Most samples (21) were collected in 2019 and 2020. All 29 T. mentagrophytes isolates were sequenced (internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1-α)). All were identified as genotype VIII (India) of T. mentagrophytes. In vitro resistance testing revealed 13/29 strains (45%) to be terbinafine-resistant with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints ≥0.2 µg/mL. The remaining 16 strains (55%) were terbinafine-sensitive. Point mutation analysis revealed that 10/13 resistant strains exhibited Phe397Leu amino acid substitution of squalene epoxidase (SQLE), indicative for in vitro resistance to terbinafine. Two resistant strains showed combined Phe397Leu and Ala448Thr amino acid substitutions, and one strain a single Leu393Phe amino acid substitution. Out of 16 terbinafine-sensitive strains, in eight Ala448Thr, and in one Ala448Thr +, new Val444 Ile amino acid substitutions were detected. Resistance to both itraconazole and voriconazole was observed in three out of 13 analyzed strains. Treatment included topical ciclopirox olamine plus topical miconazole or sertaconazole. Oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for four to eight weeks was found to be adequate. Terbinafine-resistant T. mentagrophytes Type VIII are being increasingly isolated. In Germany, transmission of T. mentagrophytes Type VIII from the Indian subcontinent to Europe should be viewed as a significant public health issue.
Large conductance, Ca(2+)- and voltage-gated K(+) (BK) channel proteins are ubiquitously expressed in cell membranes and control a wide variety of biological processes. Membrane cholesterol regulates the activity of membrane-associated proteins, including BK channels. Cholesterol modulation of BK channels alters action potential firing, colonic ion transport, smooth muscle contractility, endothelial function, and the channel alcohol response. The structural bases underlying cholesterol-BK channel interaction are unknown. Such interaction is determined by strict chemical requirements for the sterol molecule, suggesting cholesterol recognition by a protein surface. Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol action on BK channel-forming Cbv1 proteins is mediated by their cytosolic C tail domain, where we identified seven cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus motifs (CRAC4 to 10), a distinct feature of BK proteins. Cholesterol sensitivity is provided by the membrane-adjacent CRAC4, where Val-444, Tyr-450, and Lys-453 are required for cholesterol sensing, with hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions participating in cholesterol location and recognition. However, cumulative truncations or Tyr-to-Phe substitutions in CRAC5 to 10 progressively blunt cholesterol sensitivity, documenting involvement of multiple CRACs in cholesterol-BK channel interaction. In conclusion, our study provides for the first time the structural bases of BK channel cholesterol sensitivity; the presence of membrane-adjacent CRAC4 and the long cytosolic C tail domain with several other CRAC motifs, which are not found in other members of the TM6 superfamily of ion channels, very likely explains the unique cholesterol sensitivity of BK channels.
Side chain fluorination is often used to make analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] resistant to degradation by 24-hydroxylase. The fluorinated nonsteroidal analogs CD578, WU515, and WY1113 have an increased prodifferentiating action on SW480-ADH colon cancer cells, which correlated with stronger induction of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-coactivator interactions and stronger repression of beta-catenin/TCF activity. Cocrystallization of analog CD578 with the zebrafish (z)VDR and an SRC-1 coactivator peptide showed that the fluorine atoms of CD578 make additional contacts with Val444 and Phe448 of activation helix 12 (H12) of the zVDR and with Leu440 of the H11-H12 loop. Consequently, the SRC-1 peptide makes more contacts with the VDR-CD578 complex than with the VDR-1,25(OH)2D3 complex. These data show that fluorination not only affects degradation of an analog but can also have direct effects on H12 stabilization.
To examine whether the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain Pro47-Asp87 is involved in the interaction of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with platelets, we have expressed this domain in E. coli. The peptide fragment was produced from a plasmid expression vector as a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase Met1-Val444 at high yield in eight clones of E. coli. The fusion protein was purified and subjected to mild acid hydrolysis with formic acid, then the peptide Pro47-Asp87, identified by immunoblotting using specific antibodies to t-PA, was isolated by HPLC. After incubation with blood platelets spin labelled with 16-doxylstearic acid or 5-doxylstearic acid, the Pro47-Asp87 peptide fragment reduced fluidity of the membrane lipid bilayer to the same extent as did intact t-PA as indicated by ESR measurements. Our data suggest that the EGF-like domain of t-PA can directly interact with blood platelets and thus it seems to contain those sites of the t-PA molecule that bind the platelet membrane components."

The patient seemed to be homozygous, although this substitution was absent in both asymptomatic parents. Since two identical de novo mutations are highly unlikely, we tested for unsuccessful amplification of one allele. We found a novel polymorphism in the complementary sequence of a primer widely used for selective amplification of the von Willebrand factor gene.
von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric plasma glycoprotein that mediates platelet adhesion to the subendothelium via binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and to components of the vessel wall. Recently, missense mutations that cause type IIB von Willebrand disease (vWD) were described, clustered within a disulfide loop in the A1 domain of vWF that has binding sites for GPIb, collagen, and heparin. In type IIB vWD, plasma vWF exhibits increased affinity for platelet GPIb, but decreased binding to collagen and heparin. The effect was studied of a type IIB vWD mutation, Arg578-->Gln, on the interaction of vWF with GPIb, collagen, and heparin. Recombinant wild type rvWF and mutant rvWF(R578Q) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF(R578Q) to GPIb was markedly increased compared with rvWF, confirming that the Arg578-->Gln mutation causes the characteristic gain-of-function abnormality of type IIB vWD; botrocetin-induced binding was only slightly increased. Binding to collagen type III and heparin-agarose was compared for rvWF(R578Q) and plasma vWF from patients with four different type IIB mutations: Arg543-->Trp, Arg545-->Cys, Val553-->Met, Arg578-->Gln. For all of the plasma samples, binding to collagen and to heparin was reduced compared with normal plasma. In contrast, binding of rvWF(R578Q) to collagen and heparin was normal compared with wild type rvWF. Therefore, the Arg578-->Gln mutation increases the affinity of vWF for GPIb but does not directly impair vWF interaction with collagen or heparin. Arg578 may therefore be necessary to prevent normal vWF from interacting with GPIb. In type IIB vWD, the defective binding of plasma vWF to collagen and heparin may be secondary to post-synthetic modifications that occur in vivo, such as the loss of high molecular weight vWF multimers.
von Willebrand disease (vWD) variant type IIB is an inherited bleeding disorder resulting from the spontaneous binding of defective von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelets in vivo. To identify the molecular basis for type IIB vWD, we used reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to examine the nucleotide sequence of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-binding domain encoded by the vWF messenger RNA in an affected family, and in an unrelated affected individual. We identified two different missense mutations linked with expression of type IIB vWD. These mutations, which lead to Pro574----Leu and Val553----Met substitutions, respectively, were each introduced into the full-length vWF expression vector pvW198, and both wild-type (wt) and mutant vWF were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Binding assays showed that both mutant proteins showed significant non-ristocetin-dependent spontaneous binding to platelets, and that complete binding was induced by low concentrations of ristocetin that failed to induce platelet binding by wt vWF. The vWF/platelet interaction was inhibited by the anti-vWF monoclonal antibody (MoAb) AvW3, and the anti-GPIb MoAb AP1, which both block vWF binding to platelets. These results show that the identified missense mutations are the likely basis for the expression of type IIB vWD in these affected individuals.
Type IIB von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is characterized by the selective loss of large von Willebrand Factor (vWF) multimers from plasma, presumably due to their increased reactivity with platelets and subsequent clearance from the circulation. Using the PCR, one of a panel of four potential missense mutations was identified in each of the 14 patients studied from 11 unrelated families. None of these substitutions was encountered in a large panel of normal DNAs. These changes all represent C----T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, proposed ""hot spots"" for mutation in the human genome. The four resulting amino acid substitutions, Arg543----Trp, Arg545----Cys, Val553----Met, and Arg578----Gln, are all clustered within the GpIb binding domain of vWF. Disruption of this latter functional domain may explain the pathogenesis of Type IIB vWD. By sequence polymorphism analysis, the Arg543----Trp substitution was shown to have occurred as at least two independent mutational events. This latter observation, along with the identification of mutations in all 14 patients studied and their localization to the GpIb binding domain, all strongly suggest that these substitutions represent the authentic defects responsible for Type IIB vWD. This panel of mutations may provide a useful diagnostic tool for the majority of patients with Type IIB vWD."

In order to accurately study this mechanism, the scientific community needs a crystal structure of the Wild type AR (WT-AR) ligand binding domain, bound with antagonist. To address this open need, we leveraged molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to construct a structure of the WT-AR ligand binding domain bound with antagonist bicalutamide. The structure of mutant AR (Mut-AR) bound with this same antagonist informed this study. After molecular docking analysis pinpointed the suitable binding orientation of a ligand in AR, the model was further optimized through 1 μs of MD simulations. Using this approach, three molecular systems were studied: (1) WT-AR bound with agonist R1881, (2) WT-AR bound with antagonist bicalutamide, and (3) Mut-AR bound with bicalutamide. Our structures were very similar to the experimentally determined structures of both WT-AR with R1881 and Mut-AR with bicalutamide, demonstrating the trustworthiness of this approach. In our model, when WT-AR is bound with bicalutamide, Val716/Lys720/Gln733, or Met734/Gln738/Glu897 move and thus disturb the positive and negative charge clumps of the AF2 site. This disruption of the AF2 site is key for understanding the impact of antagonist binding on subsequent co-regulator binding. In conclusion, the antagonist induced structural changes in WT-AR detailed in this study will enable further AR research and will facilitate AR targeting drug discovery."

Recent studies have shown that the E69K mutation was fairly sensitive to the allosteric inhibitor of SHP2 (SHP099). However, the molecular mechanism of the allosteric drug SHP099 inhibiting SHP2E69K remains unclear. Thus, the molecular dynamic simulations and the post-dynamics analyses (RMSF, PCA, DCCM, RIN and the binding free energies) for SHP2WT, SHP2WT-SHP099, SHP2E69K and SHP2E69K-SHP099 were carried out, respectively. Owing to the strong binding affinity of SHP099 to residues Thr219 and Arg220, the flexibility of linker region (residues Val209-Arg231) was reduced. Moreover, the presence of SHP099 kept the autoinhibition state of the SHP2 protein through enhancing the interactions between the linker region and Q loop in PTP domain, such as Thr219/Val490, Thr219/Asn491, Arg220/Ile488 and Leu254/Asn491. In addition, it was found that the residues (Thr219, Arg220, Leu254 and Asn491) might be the key residues responsible for the conformational changes of protein. Overall, this study may provide an important basis for understanding how the SHP099 effectively inhibited the SHP2E69K activity at the molecular level."

In this study, we examined the genetic spectrum of the LMF1 gene among subjects with severe HTG and investigated the functional significance of 6 genetic variants in vitro. All 11 exons of the LMF1 gene were sequenced in 101 Thai subjects with severe HTG. For an in vitro study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis, transient expression in cld cells, and measured LPL protein and LPL activity. We identified 2 common variants [p.(Gly36Asp) and p.(Pro562Arg)] and 12 rare variants [p.(Thr143Met), p.(Asn249Ser), p.(Ala287Val), p.(Met346Val), p.(Thr395Ile), p.(Gly410Arg), p.(Asp433Asn), p.(Asp491Asn), p.(Asn501Tyr), p.(Ala504Val), p.(Arg523His), and p.(Leu563Arg)] in 29 patients.

Here, exome sequencing analysis in a 12-year-old boy with HS disclosed a novel de novo heterozygous variant c.1934C>T in FGFR1 predicted to cause the p.(Ala645Val) amino-acid substitution. In order to evaluate whether the variant, changing a highly conserved residue of the kinase domain, affects FGFR1 function, biochemical studies were employed. We measured the FGFR1 receptor activity in FGF2-treated cell lines exogenously expressing wild-type or Ala645Val FGFR1 by monitoring the activation status of FGF2/FGFR1 downstream pathways. Our analysis highlighted that RAS/ERK1/2 signaling was significantly perturbed in cells expressing mutated FGFR1, in comparison with control cells. We also provided preliminary evidence showing a modulation of the autophagic process in cells expressing mutated FGFR1.

Here, the 21 kDa high-purity isolated DIII fragment derived from the Cry4Ba mosquito-specific toxin was achieved via optimized preparative FPLC, allowing direct rendering analyses for binding characteristics toward its target receptor-Aedes aegypti membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (Aa-mALP). Binding analysis via dotblotting revealed that the Cry4Ba-DIII truncate was capable of specific binding to nitrocellulose-bound Aa-mALP, with a binding signal comparable to its 65 kDa Cry4Ba-R203Q full-length toxin. Further determination of binding affinity via sandwich ELISA revealed that Cry4Ba-DIII exhibited a rather weak binding to Aa-mALP with a dissociation constant (Kd) of ≈1.1 × 10-7 M as compared with the full-length toxin. Intermolecular docking between the Cry4Ba-R203Q active toxin and Aa-mALP suggested that four Cry4Ba-DIII residues, i.e., Glu522, Asn552, Asn576, and Leu615, are potentially involved in such toxin-receptor interactions. Ala substitutions of each residue (E522A, N552A, N576A and L615A) revealed that only the L615A mutant displayed a drastic decrease in biotoxicity against A. aegypti larvae. Additional binding analysis revealed that the L615A-impaired toxin also exhibited a reduction in binding capability to the surface-immobilized Aa-mALP receptor, while two bio-inactive DII-mutant toxins, Y332A and F364A, which almost entirely lost their biotoxicity, apparently retained a higher degree of binding activity. Altogether, our data disclose a functional importance of the C-terminal domain of Cry4Ba for serving as a potential receptor-binding moiety in which DIII-Leu615 could conceivably be exploited for the binding to Aa-mALP, highlighting its contribution to toxin interactions with such a target receptor in mediating larval toxicity."

The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor gene (TSHR) is one of the major candidate genes associated with CH. Studies have investigated the possible correlations between the specific clinical features and the presence of TSHR variants. However, only a few reports have focused on the long-term follow-up of patients with CH. Here we present a case of CH-associated TSHR p.Arg109Gln and p.Arg450His rare compound heterozygous variants, with a follow-up performed until adolescence. The patient had high serum TSH levels during newborn screening. Oral administration of levothyroxine (l-T4) was initiated at 1 month of age. The ultrasonogram revealed normal thyroid morphology and blood flow. Reduced uptake of I-123 and negative perchlorate test was observed. A small amount of l-T4 remained needed although l-T4 could be steadily reduced by puberty. The patient was diagnosed with orthotopic, nongoitrous, and permanent CH. He had no nonclassical TSH resistance. Patients with the TSHR p.Arg109Gln compound heterozygous variant exhibit permanent CH with high TSH levels and normal or slightly lower fT4 levels. In the future, genotype identification could help predict the long-term prognosis and reduce the requirement for detailed examinations. More case studies are needed to determine the relationship between genetic variants and clinical features in CH.
Hereditary hearing loss is highly heterogeneous. Despite over 120 non-syndromic deafness genes have been identified, there are still some of novel genes and variants being explored. In the study, we investigated 105 Chinese Han children with non-syndromic, prelingual, severe-profound hearing loss by whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples. The most common deafness gene was GJB2, mainly in variant c.235delC (p.Leu79CysfsTer3). 14 children were identified with pathogenic mutations in three genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, and OTOF. Two mutations have been identified to be pathogenic and not recorded previously, including c.4691G > A (p.Trp1564Ter) and c.3928_3930dup (p.Lys1310dup) in OTOF. The rare variants c.1349G > A (p.Arg450His) and c.456 T > G (p.Asn152Lys) in GSDME, and c.1595G > T (p.Ser532Ile) in SLC26A4 were detected. The frequency of nonsense variant c.2359G > T (p.Glu787Ter) in OTOA was very high in 17 cases. Four of them were identified to be digenic inheritance, including GJB2 and COL4A4, GJB2 and EYA1, GJB2 and COL4A5, and GJB2 and DFNA5. The findings showed that a novel pathogenic variant and rare variants may be associated with severe and profound hearing loss.
Primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a common endocrine and metabolic disease. Various genetic factors, including the thyroid hormone receptor (TSHR), play an important role in CH.
Genetic defects of the TSH receptor (TSHR) signaling pathway cause a form of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) known as TSH resistance. Consistent with the physiological understanding that thyroidal iodine uptake is up-regulated by TSHR signaling, most patients with TSH resistance have low to normal thyroidal 123I uptake representing the classic TSH resistance. However, paradoxically high 123I uptake was reported in four molecularly-confirmed patients indicating nonclassic TSH resistance. Here, we report the fifth patient with the nonclassic phenotype. He was a 12-yr-old CH patient and treated with levothyroxine. At the age 11 yr, he showed slightly small thyroid gland and elevated thyroidal 123I uptake. Genetic analysis showed that he was compound heterozygous for two known missense mutations (Arg109Gln and Arg450His) in the TSHR gene. Further, the signal transduction of Arg109Gln-TSHR was defective in both Gs- and Gq-coupled pathways, while Arg450His-TSHR showed Gq-dominant defect. 123I uptake was evaluated earlier in 16 patients with TSH resistance, and a correlation between TSH levels and 123I uptake was shown in patients with specific genotypes (Arg450His or Leu653Val). Collectively, we have re-confirmed that the emergence of the nonclassic phenotype requires two factors: mutant TSHR with Gq-dominant coupling defect and relatively high levels of serum TSH.

Among them, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MEK2) is the most crucial upstream signaling pathway of ERK1/2 cascade as a therapeutic target for overcoming Ras-driven cancers. However, the mechanisms of MEK2 regulation during tumor progression remain not fully elucidated. Herein, we identified that MEK2 was post-translationally regulated by O-GlcNAcylation. We found that MEK2 associated with OGT and was modified by O-GlcNAc. Mass spectrometry analysis further verified that O-GlcNAcylation of MEK2 occurred at Thr13, which was in the docking domain for specifically identifying its target proteins. While total O-GlcNAcylation stimulated the protein stability and phosphorylation of MEK2, Thr13 O-GlcNAcylation of MEK2 specifically enhanced its Thr394 phosphorylation as well as downstream ERK1/2 activation. Genetic ablation of MEK2 O-GlcNAcylation at Thr13 abrogated its ability to promote the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Together, our data demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylation of MEK2 might be a key regulatory mechanism during tumorigenesis and is a potential therapeutic target for tumor treatment.
Fluorescent proteins derived from light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains offer advantages over green fluorescent protein (GFP) from their small size and efficacy under anaerobic conditions. The flavoprotein improved LOV (iLOV) was engineered from the blue light receptor phototropin as a reporter of viral infection. To inform the molecular basis for the improved, photoreversible, fluorescent properties of iLOV, we employed directed evolution and determined five LOV crystallographic structures. Comparative structural analyses between iLOV and its progenitors reveal mutation-induced constraints in the environment of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore; in iLOV, the methyl group of Thr-394 ""crowds"" the FMN isoalloxazine ring, Leu-470 triggers side chain ""flipping"" of Leu-472, and the terminal FMN phosphate shows increased anchoring. We further engineered iLOV variants that are readily detectable in bacterial and mammalian cells due to order-of-magnitude photostability increases. Structure determination of a resulting representative photostable iLOV (phiLOV) variant reveals additional constraints on the chromophore. Aromatic residues Tyr-401 and Phe-485 in phiLOV sandwich the FMN isoalloxazine ring from both sides, whereas Ser-390 anchors the side chain of FMN-interacting Gln-489 Our combined structural and mutational results reveal that constraining the FMN fluorophore yields improved photochemical properties for iLOV and its new photostable derivative. These findings provide a framework for structural fine-tuning of LOV scaffold proteins to maximize their potential as oxygen-independent fluorescent reporters.

The Thr394Thr and Gly482Ser polymorphisms of the PPARGC1A gene were genotyped in 307 controls and 344 type 2 diabetes patients. Single marker/haplotype association analyses and logistic re-gression analysis were performed. Significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies were observed between cases and controls for the Thr394Thr polymorphism (genotype, P=0.006; allele, Plt;0.001). The genotype AA of the Thr394Thr polymorphism and the haplotype Thr394(ACA)- Ser482 were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. No differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between cases and controls were found for the Gly482Ser polymorphism. PPARGC1A is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population in Hubei.
Cytochrome cbb(3) oxidase is a member of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily that catalyses the reduction of molecular oxygen to the water and conserves the liberated energy in the form of a proton gradient. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of subunit I from different classes of heme-copper oxidases showed that transmembrane helix VIII and the loop between transmembrane helices IX and X contain five highly conserved polar residues; Ser333, Ser340, Thr350, Asn390 and Thr394. To determine the relationship between these conserved amino acids and the activity and assembly of the cbb(3) oxidase in Rhodobacter capsulatus, each of these five conserved amino acids was substituted for alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of these mutations on catalytic activity were determined using a NADI plate assay and by measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption. The consequence of these mutations for the structural integrity of the cbb(3) oxidase was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of chromatophore membranes followed by TMBZ staining. The results indicate that the Asn390Ala mutation led to a complete loss of enzyme activity and that the Ser333Ala mutation decreased the activity significantly. The remaining mutants cause a partial loss of catalytic activity. All of the mutant enzymes, except Asn390Ala, were apparently correctly assembled and stable in the membrane of the R. capsulatus.
Synaptic targeting of GluR-A subunit-containing glutamate receptors involves an interaction with synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97). The C-terminus of GluR-A, which contains a class I PDZ ligand motif (-x-Ser/Thr-x-phi-COOH where phi is an aliphatic amino acid) associates preferentially with the second PDZ domain of SAP97 (SAP97(PDZ2)). To understand the structural basis of this interaction, we have determined the crystal structures of wild-type and a SAP97(PDZ2) variant in complex with an 18-mer C-terminal peptide (residues 890-907) of GluR-A and of two variant PDZ2 domains in unliganded state at 1.8-2.44 A resolutions. SAP97(PDZ2) folds to a compact globular domain comprising six beta-strands and two alpha-helices, a typical architecture for PDZ domains. In the structure of the peptide complex, only the last four C-terminal residues of the GluR-A are visible, and align as an antiparallel beta-strand in the binding groove of SAP97(PDZ2). The free carboxylate group and the aliphatic side chain of the C-terminal leucine (Leu907), and the hydroxyl group of Thr905 of the GluR-A peptide are engaged in essential class I PDZ interactions. Comparison between the free and complexed structures reveals conformational changes which take place upon peptide binding. The betaAlpha-betaBeta loop moves away from the C-terminal end of alphaB leading to a slight opening of the binding groove, which may better accommodate the peptide ligand. The two conformational states are stabilized by alternative hydrogen bond and coulombic interactions of Lys324 in betaAlpha-betaBeta loop with Asp396 or Thr394 in betaBeta. Results of in vitro binding and immunoprecipitation experiments using a PDZ motif-destroying L907A mutation as well as the insertion of an extra alanine residue between the C-terminal Leu907 and the stop codon are also consistent with a 'classical' type I PDZ interaction between SAP97 and GluR-A C-terminus."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14742687/","Solenopsis invicta is a main issue in southern China and is causing significant damage to the local ecological environment. The extensive use of insecticides has resulted in the development of tolerance in S. invicta. In our study, ten S. invicta colonies from Sichuan Province exhibited varying degrees of tolerance against flonicamid, with LC50 values from 0.49 mg/L to 8.54 mg/L. The sensitivity of S. invicta to flonicamid significantly increased after treatment with the P450 enzyme inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Additionally, the activity of P450 in S. invicta was significantly enhanced after being treated with flonicamid. Flonicamid induced the expression levels of CYP4aa1, CYP9e2, CYP4C1, and CYP6A14. The expression levels of these P450 genes were significantly higher in the tolerant colonies compared to the sensitive colonies, and the relative copy numbers of CYP6A14 in the tolerant colonies were 2.01-2.15 fold. RNAi feeding treatment effectively inhibited the expression of P450 genes, thereby reducing the tolerance of S. invicta against flonicamid. In addition, the overexpression of CYP6A14 in D. melanogaster resulted in reduced sensitivity to flonicamid. Our investigations revealed hydrophobic interactions between flonicamid and seven amino acid residues of CYP6A14, along with the formation of a hydrogen bond between Glu306 and flonicamid. Our findings suggest that flonicamid can effectively control S. invicta and P450 plays a pivotal role in the tolerance of S. invicta against flonicamid. The overexpression of CYP6A14 also increased tolerance to flonicamid.
TWIK-related two-pore domain K+ channels (TREKs) are regulated by intracellular pH (pHi) and Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Previously, Glu306 in proximal C-terminal (pCt) of mouse TREK-1 was identified as the pHi-sensing residue. The direction of PI(4,5)P2 sensitivity is controversial, and we have recently shown that TREKs are inhibited by intracellular ATP via endogenous PI(4,5)P2 formation. Here we investigate the anionic and cationic residues of pCt for the pHi and ATP-sensitivity in human TREK-2 (hTREK-2). In inside-out patch clamp recordings (ITREK-2,i-o), acidic pHi-induced activation was absent in E332A and was partly attenuated in E335A. Neutralization of cationic Lys (K330A) also eliminated the acidic pHi sensitivity of ITREK-2,i-o. Unlike the inhibition of wild-type (WT) ITREK-2,i-o by intracellular ATP, neither E332A nor K330A was sensitive to ATP. Nevertheless, exogenous PI(4,5)P2 (10 μM) abolished ITREK-2 i-o in all the above mutants as well as in WT, indicating unspecific inhibition by exogenous PI(4,5)P2. In whole-cell recordings of TREK-2 (ITREK-2,w-c), K330A and E332A showed higher or fully active basal activity, showing attenuated or insignificant activation by 2-APB, arachidonic acid, or acidic pHe 6.9. ITREK-1,w-c of WT is largely suppressed by pHe 6.9, and the inhibition is slightly attenuated in K312A and E315A. The results show concerted roles of the oppositely charged Lys and Glu in pCt for the ATP-dependent low basal activity and pHi sensitivity.
Genetic studies were performed to identify the causative mutation in a 15-year-old girl diagnosed with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) presenting Mizuo-Nakamura phenomenon, a typical Oguchi disease symptom. The patient also had dural sinus thrombosis (DST), thrombocytopenia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
A truncated form of human procaspase-9 missing the first 111 amino acids, and a variety of mutants derived therefrom, have been expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. Upon refolding to active enzymes, Delta(1-111) procaspase-9 and mutants were recovered at purity greater than 95% and with a final yield of 20-35 mg/L cell culture. Our active procaspase-9 retains its pro-segment, while undergoing major auto processing at Asp315 and a minor (20%) cleavage at Glu306. This unusual cleavage at a Glu-X bond also took place in the D315E mutant, and we describe herein the inhibitor Z-VAE-fmk that shows enhanced inactivation of procaspase-9 over caspases-3. The bond at Asp330, not processed by procaspase-9, is cleaved by caspase-3 and the resulting procaspase-9 variant, missing the 316-330 bridge, is six times as active as the non-mutated Delta(1-111) proenzyme. A deletion mutant lacking residues 316-330 underwent auto activation by cleavage at Asp315-Ala331 bond. Moreover, substitution of Glu306 by an Asp residue in this mutant led to rapid removal of the peptide spanning Ser307 to Asp330, and resulted in an enzyme that was 7.6 times as active as the non-mutated Delta(1-111) procaspase-9. Finally, replacing both Asp315 and Glu306 with Ala generated a procaspase-9 mutant incapable of auto processing. This single chain procaspase-9 was fully as active as the non-mutated Delta(1-111) enzyme processed at Asp315 or Glu306. Our demonstration that unprocessed procaspase-9 mutants are active as proteases with caspase-type specificity suggests that the role of procaspase-9 in cascade activation of executioner caspases might, in some circumstances, be carried out alone and without association of the apoptosome.
Nitrous oxide, xenon, and cyclopropane are anesthetic gases that have a distinct pharmacological profile. Whereas the molecular basis for their anesthetic actions remains unclear, they behave very differently to most other general anesthetics in that they have little or no effect on GABAA receptors, yet strongly inhibit the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors. Here we show that certain members of the two-pore-domain K+ channel superfamily may represent an important new target for these gaseous anesthetics. TREK-1 is markedly activated by clinically relevant concentrations of nitrous oxide, xenon, and cyclopropane. In contrast, TASK-3, a member of this family that is very sensitive to volatile anesthetics, such as halothane, is insensitive to the anesthetic gases. We demonstrate that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is not an absolute requirement for the actions of the gases, although it clearly plays an important modulatory role. Finally, we show that Glu306, an amino acid that has previously been found to be important in the modulation of TREK-1 by arachidonic acid, membrane stretch and internal pH, is critical for the activating effects of the anesthetic gases."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8186255/","An important step in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is the immunohistochemical analysis of the components of the sarcoglycan complex in a muscle biopsy specimen. Even though a primary mutation in any of the four sarcoglycan genes (alpha-, beta-,gamma-, delta-sarcoglycan) may cause secondary deficiencies in all the other sarcoglycan proteins, more specific immunohistochemical patterns have emerged with the potential to guide and abbreviate the necessary molecular genetic investigations. In gamma-sarcoglycan mutations, the pattern consists of absent or prominently reduced gamma-sarcoglycan immunoreactivity in combination with reduced but detectable immunoreactivity for the other components, with preservation of delta-sarcoglycan. In five consecutive patients, this pattern was able to predict primary gamma-sarcoglycan mutations. Five different mutations were found, including a recurrent novel splice mutation, a large deletion of the entire gene and a novel missense mutation (Leu90Ser). The mutation Cys283Tyr, previously restricted to Gypsy populations was found in compound heterozygosity with del521T, common in north Africa. The variety of known and novel mutations found indicates that the immunohistochemical profile of gamma-sarcoglycan mutations is not restricted to a particular mutation or type of mutation, but rather is a general reflection of the effect of gamma-sarcoglycan mutations on the composition of the sarcoglycan complex. Complete immunohistochemical analysis with all available sarcoglycan antibodies, therefore, is a useful tool to guide the molecular genetic investigations that are necessary to arrive at the correct genetic diagnosis in a given case.
We report two siblings with a relatively severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The elder sister presented at 8 years of age with inability to climb and abnormal gait. At 12 years she was barely ambulant. Her sister followed a similar course. Serum creatine kinase was 8500-10000 IU (N 25-200) in the elder sister and 17000-19000 IU in the younger sister. Muscle biopsy of the elder sister at 8 years showed chronic myopathic changes with loss of muscle fibres, active necrosis and regeneration. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated normal spectrin and dystrophin, reduced alpha-sarcoglycan and absent gamma-sarcoglycan--indicating a gamma-sarcoglycanopathy. Haplotype analysis for the markers D13S115, D13S232, D13S292, D13S787, D13S1243 and D13S283 internal to and flanking the gamma-sarcoglycan gene showed the affected sisters shared haplotypes, indicating it was possible they were suffering from a gamma-sarcoglycanopathy. Non-inheritance of paternal alleles for D13S232, D13S292 and D13S1243 suggested the inheritance of a deletion, which was confirmed by FISH, using a genomic probe from the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. The gamma-sarcoglycan cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR from the muscle biopsy of the elder sister and sequenced. A missense mutation changing codon 69 from GGC glycine to CGC arginine was identified. HhaI digestion of exon 3 genomic PCR products showed the two affected sisters were hemizygous for the mutation, while the mother and grandmother were heterozygotes. The mutation, identified by SSCP analysis, was not observed in 116 unrelated, unaffected individuals. Previously, only two other missense mutations, the Cys283Tyr missense mutation in Gypsies and the Leu193Ser mutation in a Dutch family, have been described in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. The fact that the affected individuals in the current and Gypsy families are gamma-sarcoglycan negative may indicate that codons 69 and 283 are important in gamma-sarcoglycan function.
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the amino-acid residues at the presumed catalytic site Cys-283 and ATP binding site Asp-340 of human creatine kinase B cDNA. In addition, a highly conserved arginine residue, Arg-292, was also mutated. Transfection of 0.1 to 1 microgram of recombinant plasmid into COS cells produced increasing creatine kinase activity in the cell lysate. The expression of mutant Cys283-Tyr and Cys283-Ser resulted in complete abolition of homodimer BB isoform enzymatic activity without alteration of the capacity for dimerization. Expression of mutants Arg292-His, Arg292-Leu, and Arg292-Gln produced non-functional homodimers, whereas expression of mutant Arg292-Lys produced a homodimer with enzymatic activity that was 42% of the enzymatic activity of the wild type. Expression of the Asp340-Glu mutant creatine kinase did not alter enzyme activity as compared to the wild type. Following heterodimerization, there was inhibition of the normal subunit by the mutant subunit, for both the BB and the MB dimer. The results showed residues Cys-283 and Arg-292 are essential for enzyme catalysis. The best fit model for the dimer is one in which there is close apposition of the two catalytic sites. The interaction of the individual subunits during dimerization provides a molecular approach for dominant negative modulation of the creatine kinase isozyme system in future genetic manipulative experiments."

Edoxaban is an oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor and its efficacy as an oral anticoagulant is less subject to drug-food and drug-drug interaction than existing vitamin K antagonists. Although this profile of edoxaban suggests it is well suited for clinical use, it is not clear whether genetic variations of factor X influence the activity of edoxaban. Our aim was to investigate a possible impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the factor X gene on the functions of factor X and the activity of edoxaban. Two nonsynonymous SNPs within mature factor X, Ala152Thr and Gly192Arg, were selected as possible candidates that might affect the functions of FXa and the activity of edoxaban. We measured catalytic activities of wild type and mutant FXas in a chromogenic assay using S-2222 and coagulation times including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thrombin time (aPTT) of plasma-containing recombinant FXs in the presence and absence of edoxaban. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters of FXas, Km and Vmax values, PT and aPTT were not influenced by either mutation indicating these mutations do not affect the FXa catalytic and coagulation activities. The Ki values of edoxaban for the FXas and the concentrations of edoxaban required to double PT and aPTT were not different between wild type and mutated FXas indicating that both mutations have little impact on the activity of edoxaban. In conclusion, these data suggest that edoxaban has little interpatient variability stemming from SNPs in the factor X gene."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14966119/","In Gram-negative bacteria, the first step of lipid A biosynthesis is catalyzed by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (LpxA) through the transfer of a R-3-hydroxyacyl chain from the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to the 3-hydroxyl group of UDP-GlcNAc. Previous studies suggest that LpxA is a critical determinant of the acyl chain length found in lipid A, which varies among species of bacteria. In Escherichia coli and Leptospira interrogans, LpxA prefers to incorporate longer R-3-hydroxyacyl chains (C14 and C12, respectively), whereas in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the enzyme is selective for R-3-hydroxydecanoyl, a 10-hydrocarbon long acyl chain. We now report three P. aeruginosa LpxA crystal structures: apo protein, substrate complex with UDP-GlcNAc, and product complex with UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxydecanoyl)-GlcNAc. A comparison between the apo form and complexes identifies key residues that position UDP-GlcNAc appropriately for catalysis and supports the role of catalytic His121 in activating the UDP-GlcNAc 3-hydroxyl group for nucleophilic attack during the reaction. The product-complex structure, for the first time, offers structural insights into how Met169 serves to constrain the length of the acyl chain and thus functions as the so-called hydrocarbon ruler. Furthermore, compared with ortholog LpxA structures, the purported oxyanion hole, formed by the backbone amide group of Gly139, displays a different conformation in P. aeruginosa LpxA, which suggests flexibility of this structural feature important for catalysis and the potential need for substrate-induced conformational change in catalysis. Taken together, the three structures provide valuable insights into P. aeruginosa LpxA catalysis and substrate specificity as well as templates for future inhibitor discovery.
Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes heme degradation, one of its products being carbon monoxide (CO). It is well known that CO has a higher affinity for heme iron than does molecular oxygen (O(2)); therefore, CO is potentially toxic. Because O(2) is required for the HO reaction, HO must discriminate effectively between CO and O(2) and thus escape product inhibition. Previously, we demonstrated large conformational changes in the heme-HO-1 complex upon CO binding that arise from steric hindrance between CO bound to the heme iron and Gly-139. However, we have not yet identified those changes that are specific to CO binding and do not occur upon O(2) binding. Here we determine the crystal structure of the O(2)-bound form at 1.8 Å resolution and reveal the structural changes that are specific to CO binding. Moreover, difference Fourier maps comparing the structures before and after CO photolysis at <160 K clearly show structural changes such as movement of the distal F-helix upon CO photolysis. No such changes are observed upon O(2) photolysis, consistent with the structures of the ligand-free, O(2)-bound, and CO-bound forms. Protein motions even at cryogenic temperatures imply that the CO-bound heme-HO-1 complex is severely constrained (as in ligand binding to the T-state of hemoglobin), indicating that CO binding to the heme-HO-1 complex is specifically inhibited by steric hindrance. The difference Fourier maps also suggest new routes for CO migration.
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the degradation of heme to iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, performs a cytoprotective function. Previous studies on the crystal structure of the human and rat HO-1 in complex with heme showed that Gly139His (G139H) and Gly143His (G143H) mutants have no HO activity. In the present study, we reported the effect of the G139H, G143H, and Ser142His mutants of mouse HO-1 on the HO reaction in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, of the mutant transfectants, only Ser142His catalyzed degradation of heme, retaining 31.7% of the wild-type mouse HO-1 activity, whereas G139H and G143H mutants exhibited no activity. In vivo, only Tg HO-1 G143H females presented with anemia, enlarged spleen and tissue iron overload, which was similar to HO-1(-/-) mice. The results suggested the critical role of Gly139 and Gly143 in maintaining HO-1 activity in vitro and the critical role of Gly143 in maintaining HO-1 activity in vivo.
Conserved glycines, Gly139 and Gly143, in the distal helix of human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) provide the flexibility required for the opening and closing of the heme active site for substrate binding and product dissociation during HO-1 catalysis. Earlier mutagenesis work on human HO-1 showed that replacement of either Gly139 or Gly143 suppresses heme oxygenase activity and, in the case of the Gly139 mutants, increases peroxidase activity (Liu et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 275:34501, 2000). To further investigate the role of the conserved distal helix glycines, we have determined the crystal structures of the human HO-1 G139A mutant, the G139A mutant in a complex with NO, and the G143H mutant at 1.88, 2.18 and 2.08 A, respectively. The results confirm that fine tuning of the previously noted active-site hydrogen-bonding network is critical in determining whether heme oxygenase or peroxidase activity is observed.
HmuO, a heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, catalyzes degradation of heme using the same mechanism as the mammalian enzyme. The oxy form of HmuO, the precursor of the catalytically active ferric hydroperoxo species, has been characterized by ligand binding kinetics, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography. The oxygen association and dissociation rate constants are 5 microm(-1) s(-1) and 0.22 s(-1), respectively, yielding an O(2) affinity of 21 microm(-1), which is approximately 20 times greater than that of mammalian myoglobins. However, the affinity of HmuO for CO is only 3-4-fold greater than that for mammalian myoglobins, implying the presence of strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the distal pocket of HmuO that preferentially favor O(2) binding. Resonance Raman spectra show that the Fe-O(2) vibrations are tightly coupled to porphyrin vibrations, indicating the highly bent Fe-O-O geometry that is characteristic of the oxy forms of heme oxygenases. In the crystal structure of the oxy form the Fe-O-O angle is 110 degrees, the O-O bond is pointed toward the heme alpha-meso-carbon by direct steric interactions with Gly-135 and Gly-139, and hydrogen bonds occur between the bound O(2) and the amide nitrogen of Gly-139 and a distal pocket water molecule, which is a part of an extended hydrogen bonding network that provides the solvent protons required for oxygen activation. In addition, the O-O bond is orthogonal to the plane of the proximal imidazole side chain, which facilitates hydroxylation of the porphyrin alpha-meso-carbon by preventing premature O-O bond cleavage."

Here site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) was used for the first time to investigate the functional significance of the conserved amino acid residues Ser10, Gly54, Asn82, Asn213, and His216 in the active site of SrL. The hydrolytic activity of SrL variants was determined using para-nitrophenyl (pNP) esters with C4, C8, and C16 fatty acid chains. Mutation of Ser10, Asn82, or His216, but not Gly54, to Ala abolished lipase activity for all substrates. In contrast, the Asn213Ala variant showed increased enzymatic activity for C8 and C16 pNP esters. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the interactions between the long alkyl chain substrate (C16) and Ser10 and Asn82 were strongest in Asn213Ala SrL. In addition to Asn82, Gly54, and Ser10, several new constituents of the substrate binding site were recognized (Lys28, Ser53, Thr89, and Glu212), as well as strong electrostatic interactions between Lys28 and Glu212. In addition to the H bonds Ser10-His216 and His216-Ser214, Tyr11 interacted strongly with Ser10 and His216 in all complexes with an active enzyme form. A previously unknown strong H bond between the catalytically important Asn82 and Gly54 was uncovered, which stabilizes the substrate in an orientation suitable for the enzyme reaction.
Developmentally regulated Guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding protein 1 (DRG1) is a highly conserved member of a class of GTPases implicated in translation.

It was found that silkworm serine protease inhibitors BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 were very different from typical TIL-type protease inhibitors in sequence, structure, and activity. BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 with unique structure and activity may be good models for studying the relationship between the structure and function of small-molecule TIL-type protease inhibitors. In this study, site-directed saturation mutagenesis at the P1 position was conducted to investigate the effect of P1 sites on the inhibitory activity and specificity of BmSPI38 and BmSPI39. In-gel activity staining and protease inhibition experiments confirmed that BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 could strongly inhibit elastase activity. Almost all mutant proteins of BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 retained the inhibitory activities against subtilisin and elastase, but the replacement of P1 residues greatly affected their intrinsic inhibitory activities. Overall, the substitution of Gly54 in BmSPI38 and Ala56 in BmSPI39 with Gln, Ser, or Thr was able to significantly enhance their inhibitory activities against subtilisin and elastase. However, replacing P1 residues in BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 with Ile, Trp, Pro, or Val could seriously weaken their inhibitory activity against subtilisin and elastase. The replacement of P1 residues with Arg or Lys not only reduced the intrinsic activities of BmSPI38 and BmSPI39, but also resulted in the acquisition of stronger trypsin inhibitory activities and weaker chymotrypsin inhibitory activities. The activity staining results showed that BmSPI38(G54K), BmSPI39(A56R), and BmSPI39(A56K) had extremely high acid-base and thermal stability. In conclusion, this study not only confirmed that BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 had strong elastase inhibitory activity, but also confirmed that P1 residue replacement could change their activity and inhibitory specificity. This not only provides a new perspective and idea for the exploitation and utilization of BmSPI38 and BmSPI39 in biomedicine and pest control, but also provides a basis or reference for the activity and specificity modification of TIL-type protease inhibitors.
The galectin family is a representative soluble lectin group, which is responsible for the modulation of various cell functions. Although the carbohydrate-binding specificity of galectins has been well-studied, the relationship between protein structure and specificity remains to be elucidated. We previously reported the characteristics of a Xenopus laevis skin galectin, xgalectin-Va, which had diverged from galectin-1. The carbohydrate selectivity of xgalectin-Va was different from that of human galectin-1 and xgalectin-Ib (a Xenopus laevis galectin-1 homolog). In this study, we clarified the key residues for this selectivity by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of two amino acids of xgalectin-Va, Val56Gly/Lys76Arg, greatly enhanced the binding ability to N-acetyllactosamine and conferred significant T-cell growth inhibition activity, although the wild type had no activity. These two residues, Gly54 and Arg74 in galectin-1, would cooperatively contribute to the N-acetyllactosamine recognition. The loop region between the S4 and S5 β-strands was involved in the binding to the TF-antigen disaccharide. The loop substitution successfully changed the carbohydrate selectivity of xgalectin-Va and xgalectin-Ib.
Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is one of the congenital cardiovascular diseases characterized by stenosis of the aorta. The stenotic lesions occur anywhere above the aortic valve in the aortic tree as well as pulmonary arteries and eventually leads to circulatory failure. The disease gene has been identified on the elastin gene (ELN) and two types of SVAS have been categorized; a familial type and an isolated type with the de novo mutation."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15863669/","Since depression is a common mental illness affecting an estimated 5% of people worldwide, investigators are encouraged to develop effective antidepressants. According to the monoamine-deficiency hypothesis, the underlying pathophysiology of depression is a deficiency of some neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine) in the central nervous system. The neurotransmitter serotonin has drawn the most attention concerning depression. As per research, 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) elevates inter-synaptic serotonin levels when administered as a single inhalation of vapor from dried toad secretion and leads to higher life satisfaction, convergent thinking, higher ratings of mindfulness, lower ratings of depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, although 5-MeO-DMT lowers stress biomarkers such as cortisol, it is a psychedelic with hallucinogenic effects. In the present study, analogues of 5-MeO-DMT are designed with the hope that they might have better therapeutic activity and lower psychedelic side effects. The current study aimed to look at 5-MeO-DMT analogues as possible antidepressants. We used 70,000 5-MeO-DMT analogues that were sketched using Marvin to conduct a High Throughput Virtual Screening method in hopes of finding potential 5-MeO-DMT analogues against the 5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HT1AR; 7E2Y.pdb) as an agonist. The prediction of the analogue-protein interaction and the evaluation of the binding affinity is accomplished by employing molecular docking. The Glide XP docking data indicated that a total of 21 compounds had Glide gscores ranging from -11.41 to -6.53 kcal/mol. When compared to the standard 5-MeO-DMT with the binding affinity of -7.75 kcal/mol, 14 compounds showed better binding affinity. Furthermore, Molecular Mechanics -Generalised Born and Surface Area solvation (MM-GBSA) indicated a binding free energy range of -63.55 to -35.37 kcal/mol, and 18 compounds showed better binding free energy than standard 5-MeO-DMT (-41.42 kcal/mol). Through ligand binding interactions with Asp116, Phe361, Phe362, Ser190, Ser199, Val117, Trp358, Ala365, Pro369, Ile189, Tyr195, Ala203, Ile167, Tyr390, Cys120, Trp358, Val364, Ala365, and Leu368, these complexes were stabilized, according to the molecular dynamic simulation of 20453/7E2Y in 100ns.
White-rot basidiomycetes are the organisms that decompose lignin most efficiently, and Trametes villosa is a promising species for ligninolytic enzyme production. There are several publications on T. villosa applications for lignin degradation regarding the expression and secretion of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) but no reports on the identification and characterization of lignin peroxidase (LiP), a relevant enzyme for the efficient breakdown of lignin. The object of this study was to identify and partially characterize, for the first time, gDNA, mRNA, and the corresponding lignin peroxidase (TvLiP) protein from T. villosa strain CCMB561 from the Brazilian semiarid region. The presence of ligninolytic enzymes produced by this strain grown in inducer media was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by spectrophotometry, qPCR, and dye fading using Remazol Brilliant Blue R. The spectrophotometric analysis showed that LiP activity was higher than that of MnP. The greatest LiP expression as measured by qPCR occurred on the 7th day, and the ABSA medium (agar, sugarcane bagasse, and ammonium sulfate) was the best that favored LiP expression. The amplification of the TvLiP gene median region covering approximately 50% of the T. versicolor LPGIV gene (87% identity); the presence of Trp199, Leu115, Asp193, Trp199, and Ala203 in the translated amplicon of the T. villosa mRNA; and the close phylogenetic relationship between TvLiP and T. versicolor LiP all indicate that the target enzyme is a lignin peroxidase. Therefore, T. villosa CCMB561 has great potential for use as a LiP, MnP, and Lac producer for industrial applications.
The CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) receptor is a family B GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor). It consists of a GPCR, CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) and an accessory protein, RAMP1 (receptor activity-modifying protein 1). RAMP1 is needed for CGRP binding and also cell-surface expression of CLR. There have been few systematic studies of the ECLs (extracellular loops) of family B GPCRs. However, they are likely to be especially important for the interaction of the N-termini of the peptide agonists that are the natural agonists for these receptors. We have carried out alanine scans on all three ECLs of CLR, as well as their associated juxtamembrane regions. Residues within all three loops influence CGRP binding and receptor activation. Mutation of Ala203 and Ala206 on ECL1 to leucine increased the affinity of CGRP. Residues at the top of TM (transmembrane) helices 2 and 3 influenced CGRP binding and receptor activation. L351A and E357A in TM6/ECL3 reduced receptor expression and may be needed for CLR association with RAMP1. ECL2 seems especially important for CLR function; of the 16 residues so far examined in this loop, eight residues reduce the potency of CGRP at stimulating cAMP production when mutated to alanine.
The M4 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) is a potential therapeutic target but characterized by a lack of subtype-selective ligands. We recently generated ""designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug"" (DREADDs), which contained mutations of two conserved orthosteric-site residues (Y113C/A203G in the M4 mAChR) that caused a loss of ACh activity but a gain in responsiveness to clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). The current study characterized the interactions of the wild type and the M4 DREADD with a range of agonists, antagonists, and the recently discovered M4 mAChR allosteric potentiator, 3-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy-4-methyl-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid cyclopropylamide (LY2033298). LY2033298 displayed positive binding cooperativity with ACh, neutral cooperativity with the antagonist, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, and agonism for activation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 at the wild-type M4 mAChR. LY2033298's cooperativity with clozapine or CNO was weakly positive with respect to binding but profoundly negative with respect to LY2033298 signaling. Although the DREADD mutations increased the binding and function of clozapine-like compounds, all other agonists lost the ability to activate the mutant; for the orthosteric agonists ACh and pilocarpine, this was due partly to a reduced affinity, whereas the affinity of LY2033298 or the atypical agonist 4-I-[3-chlorophenyl]carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammnonium chloride was unaltered. The interaction between LY2033298 and clozapine-like compounds reverted to neutral cooperativity on the DREADD, whereas LY2033298 caused a striking functional rescue of ACh potency and efficacy at the DREADD. These results provide conclusive evidence for the retention of a functional allosteric site on the M4 DREADD and highlight a role for residues Tyr113 and Ala203 in the transmission of cooperativity.
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1beta (PGC-1beta) is a recently identified homologue of the tissue specific coactivator PGC-1alpha, a coactivator of transcription factors such as the peroxisome proliferators activated receptors and nuclear respiratory factors. PGC-1alpha is involved in adipogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid beta oxidation, and hepatic gluconeogenesis."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27344355/","Mutations in nuclear-encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance (e.g., POLG) have been associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) phenotype. These nuclear genome mutations may lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or mitochondrial DNA depletion. On the other hand, primary genetic defects of mitochondrial DNA (such as single large-scale deletion or point mutations) have also been associated with the CPEO phenotype. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) may be a manifestation of specific syndromes that, when clinically recognized, prompt clinicians to investigate specific genetic defects. Thus, CPEO, as part of Kearns Sayre syndrome, suggests the presence of a large-scale deletion of mitochondrial DNA. However, in pure CPEO or CPEO plus phenotypes, it is more difficult to know whether causative genetic defects affect the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Here, we present a patient with a long-standing history of CPEO plus phenotype, in whom the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from skeletal muscle was normal, and no other genetic defect was suspected at first. At the time of our evaluation, the presence of polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain prompted us to investigate nuclear genetic defects and, specifically, mutations in the POLG gene. Thus, the sequencing of the POLG gene revealed p.Thr251Ile and p.Pro587Leu mutations in one allele, and p.Ala467Thr mutation in another allele. Although one would expect that mutations in POLG lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or depletion (loss of copies), the absence of mitochondrial DNA abnormalities in tissue may be explained by heteroplasmy, a lack or no significant involvement of biopsied tissue, or a sampling bias. So, the absence of secondary mitochondrial DNA alterations should not discourage clinicians from further investigating mutations in nuclear-encoded genes. Lastly, mitochondrial point mutations and single mitochondrial DNA deletions very rarely cause CPEO associated with polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain, and POLG-related disease should be considered in this scenario, instead.
Diseases related to DNA polymerase gamma dysfunction comprise of heterogeneous clinical presentations with variable severity and age of onset. Molecular screening for the common POLG variants: p.Ala467Thr, p.Trp748Ser, p.Gly848Ser, and p.Tre251Ile has been conducted in a large population cohort (n = 3123) and in a clinically heterogeneous group of 1289 patients. Recessive pathogenic variants, including six novel ones were revealed in 22/26 patients. Infantile Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and adulthood ataxia spectrum were the most common found in our group. Distinct molecular profile identified in the Polish patients with significant predominance of p.Trp748Ser variant (50% of mutant alleles) reflected strikingly low population frequency of the three remaining variants and slightly higher p.Trp748Ser allele frequency in the general Polish population as compared to the non-Finish European population.
Focal status epilepticus in POLG-related mitochondrial disease is highly refractory to pharmacological agents, including general anesthesia. We report the challenges in managing a previously healthy teenager who presented with de novo epilepsia partialis continua and metabolic stroke resulting from the homozygous p.Ala467Thr POLG mutation, the most common pathogenic variant identified in the Caucasian population. We applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 2 mA; 20 min) daily as an adjunctive therapy because her focal seizures failed to respond to five antiepileptic drugs at maximal doses. The electrical and clinical seizures stopped after 3 days of tDCS. The second course of tDCS was administered for 14 days when the focal seizures re-emerged a month later. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Following 4 months of hospitalization and prolonged community rehabilitation, our patient has now returned to full-time education with support, and there is no report of cognitive deficit. We have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of tDCS in treating refractory focal motor seizures caused by mitochondrial disease.
We performed a systematic review of the clinical, molecular, and biochemical features of polymerase gamma (POLG)-related epilepsy and current evidence on seizure management. Patients were identified from a combined electronic search of articles using Ovid Medline and Scopus databases, published from January 2000 to January 2015. Only patients with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of POLG mutations were considered. Seventy-two articles were included for analysis. We identified 128 pathogenic variants in 372 patients who had POLG-related epilepsy. Among these, 84% of the cases harbored at least one of these pathogenic variants: p.Ala467Thr, p.Trp748Ser, and p.Gly848Ser. A bimodal distribution of disease onset was present in early childhood (<5 years) and adolescence; female patients had a later presentation than male patients (median age 4.00 vs. 1.83 years, p-value = 0.041). Focal-onset seizure including convulsive, myoclonus, and occipital seizures was common at the outset and was refractory to pharmacotherapy. We confirmed that homozygous pathogenic variants located in the linker region of POLG were associated with later age of onset and longer survival compared to compound heterozygous variants. In addition, biochemical and molecular heterogeneities in different tissues were frequently observed. POLG-related epilepsy is clinically heterogeneous, and the prognosis is, in part, influenced by the location of the variants in the gene and the presence of hepatic involvement. Normal muscle and fibroblast studies do no exclude the diagnosis of POLG-related mitochondrial disease and direct sequencing of the POLG gene should be the gold standard when investigating suspected cases.
The Old Order Amish populations in the US are one of the Plain People groups and are descendants of the Swiss Anabaptist immigrants who came to North America in the early eighteenth century. They live in numerous small endogamous demes that have resulted in reduced genetic diversity along with a high prevalence of specific genetic disorders, many of them autosomal recessive. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies arising from mitochondrial or nuclear DNA mutations have not previously been reported in the Plain populations. Here we present four different Amish families with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. Mutations in two mitochondrial encoded genes leading to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder were identified in two patients. In the first case, MELAS syndrome caused by a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation (m.3243A>G) was identified in an extended Amish pedigree following a presentation of metabolic strokes in the proband. Characterization of the extended family of the proband by a high resolution melting assay identified the same mutation in many previously undiagnosed family members with a wide range of clinical symptoms. A MELAS/Leigh syndrome phenotype caused by a mtDNA mutation [m.13513G>A; p.Asp393Asn] in the ND5 gene encoding the ND5 subunit of respiratory chain complex I was identified in a patient in a second family. Mutations in two nuclear encoded genes leading to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder were also identified in two patients. One patient presented with Leigh syndrome and had a homozygous deletion in the NDUFAF2 gene, while the second patient had a homozygous mutation in the POLG gene, [c.1399G>A; p.Ala467Thr]. Our findings identify mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency as a cause of disease in the Old Order Amish that must be considered in the context of otherwise unexplained systemic disease, especially if neuromuscular symptoms are present."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23561526/","SERCA is a P-type ATPase embedded in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and plays a central role in muscle relaxation. SERCA's function is regulated by single-pass membrane proteins called regulins. Unlike other regulins, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) expressed in cardiac muscle has a unique activating effect. Here, we determine the structure and topology of DWORF in lipid bilayers using a combination of oriented sample solid-state NMR spectroscopy and replica-averaged orientationally restrained molecular dynamics. We found that DWORF's structural topology consists of a dynamic N-terminal domain, an amphipathic juxtamembrane helix that crosses the lipid groups at an angle of 64°, and a transmembrane C-terminal helix with an angle of 32°. A kink induced by Pro15, unique to DWORF, separates the two helical domains. A single Pro15Ala mutant significantly decreases the kink and eliminates DWORF's activating effect on SERCA. Overall, our findings directly link DWORF's structural topology to its activating effect on SERCA.
This study was conducted to distinguish the effects of heat stress (HS) and feed intake (FI) on broiler chicken's physiological responses. Day-old male Cobb 500 broilers (n = 672) were allocated to three treatments: (1) control (CTL): birds raised under normal temperature (23°C) from day 29 to 42; (2) cyclic heat stress (CHS): birds exposed to high temperatures (8 h/day at 35°C; from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm) from day 29 to 42; (3) pair-fed (PF): birds raised under thermoneutral condition but fed the same amount of feed as CHS from day 29 to 42. On day 42, 15 birds/pen were processed, to measure carcass and meat yields. To measure blood parameters and gut integrity (using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran), on day 42, CHS birds were sampled before (Pre-CHS) and 2 h after (Post-CHS) the temperature increased. Furthermore, after sampling CTL birds, they were exposed to 2h heat and sampled (acute heat stress, AHS). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (JMP Pro15) and significance between treatments identified by LSD (P < 0.05). BW and relative carcass yield were significantly higher in CTL compared to CHS and PF. Compared to CHS, PF had significantly higher BW and lower relative carcass yield. Breast yield was significantly higher for CTL and PF, while leg quarters and wings yield were significantly lower compared to CHS. Gut barrier integrity was significantly altered in Post-CHS and AHS compared to CTL. mRNA abundances of tumor necrosis factor-α, C-C motif chemokine ligand-20, heat shock protein (HSP)-27, and HSP70 were significantly higher in Post-CHS and AHS compared to CTL. AHS had significantly higher mRNA abundances of CARD domain containing (NLRC)-3 and NLRC5 inflammasomes, and lower superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1 and SOD2 abundance compared with CTL. PF had significantly higher liver weight (% BW) compared to all other groups; while abdominal fat was significantly higher in Pre-CHS compared to CTL, PF, and AHS. Together, these data indicate that the negative effects of HS are partially due to reduced FI. However, the negative effect of HS on gut integrity, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, and meat yield are direct and independent of the reduced FI during the HS. Thus, warrant investigating the underlying mechanisms in future research.
α-Conotoxins (α-CTxs) are small disulfide-rich peptides from venom of Conus species that target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The muscle-type nAChRs have been recognized as a potential target for several diseases, such as myogenic disorders, muscle dystrophies, and myasthenia gravis. EI, an α4/7-CTx, mainly blocks α1β1δε nAChRs and has an extra N-terminal extension of three amino acids. In this study, the alanine scanning (Ala-scan) mutagenesis was applied in order to identify key residues of EI for binding with mouse α1β1δε nAChR. The Ala-substituted analogues were tested for their abilities of modulating muscle and neuronal nAChRs in Xenopus laevis oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings. Electrophysiological results indicated that the vital residues for functional activity of EI were His-7, Pro-8, Met-12, and Pro-15. These changes exhibited a significant decrease in potency of EI against mouse α1β1δε nAChR. Interestingly, replacing the critical serine (Ser) at position 13 with an alanine (Ala) residue resulted in a 2-fold increase in potency at the α1β1δε nAChR, and showed loss of activity on α3β2 and α3β4 nAChRs. Selectivity and potency of [S13A] EI was improved compared with wild-type EI (WT EI). In addition, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of EI revealed that the ""Arg1-Asn2-Hyp3"" residues at the N-terminus conferred potency at the muscle-type nAChRs, and the deletion analogue △1-3 EI caused a total loss of activity at the α1β1δε nAChR. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies demonstrated that activity loss of truncated analogue △1-3 EI for α1β1δε nAChR is attributed to disturbance of the secondary structure. In this report, an Ala-scan mutagenesis strategy is presented to identify crucial residues that are significantly affecting potency of E1 for mouse α1β1δε nAChR. It may also be important in remodeling of some novel ligands for inhibiting muscle-type nAChRs.
The membrane interaction of peptides derived from maculatin 1.1 and caerin 1.1, with the sequence motif of N and C termini of maculatin 1.1, was compared in order to understand the role of these common sequence motifs, which encompass critical proline residues, on peptide secondary structure and on membrane binding and disruption in zwitterionic and anionic membranes. The peptides incorporated a single substitution with lysine or deletion of the central region to mimic the length of the antimicrobial peptides, citropin 1.1 and aurein 1.2. The impact of these changes in the sequence, length and physicochemical properties, on lytic activity and structure was assessed by dye-release from lipid vesicles and the change in the bilayer order as a function of membrane-bound peptide mass. All peptides adopted similar degrees of helical structure in both membrane systems. In addition, all peptide analogues were less active than either maculatin 1.1 or caerin 1.1 in dye release assays. The membrane binding was analyzed by dual polarization interferometry and the results showed that membrane binding was significantly affected by changes in the hydrophobic environment of Pro-15. Moreover, changes in the relative distribution of charge and hydrophobicity flanking Pro-15 also caused significant changes to the membrane order. Overall, the proline residue plays an important role in inducing a peptide structure that enhances the activity of these antimicrobial peptides.
The role of proline in the disruption of membrane bilayer structure upon antimicrobial peptide (AMP) binding was studied. Specifically, (31)P and (2)H solid-state NMR and dual polarization interferometry (DPI) were used to analyze the membrane interactions of three AMPs: maculatin 1.1 and two analogs in which Pro-15 is replaced by Gly and Ala. For NMR, deuterated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (d54-DMPC) and d54-DMPC/dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) were used to mimic eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes, respectively. In fluid-phase DMPC bilayer systems, the peptides interacted primarily with the bilayer surface, with the native peptide having the strongest interaction. In the mixed DMPC/DMPG bilayers, maculatin 1.1 induced DMPG phase separation, whereas the analogs promoted the formation of isotropic and lipid-enriched phases with an enhanced effect relative to the neutral DMPC bilayers. In gel-phase DMPC vesicles, the native peptide disrupted the bilayer via a surface mechanism, and the effect of the analogs was similar to that observed in the fluid phase. Real-time changes in bilayer order were examined via DPI, with changes in bilayer birefringence analyzed as a function of the peptide mass bound to the bilayer. Although all three peptides decreased the bilayer order as a function of bound concentration, maculatin 1.1 caused the largest change in bilayer structure. The NMR data indicate that maculatin 1.1 binds predominantly at the surface regions of the bilayer, and both NMR and DPI results indicate that this binding leads to a drop in bilayer order. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proline at residue 15 plays a central role in the membrane interaction of maculatin 1.1 by inducing a significant change in membrane order and affecting the ability of the bilayer to recover from structural changes induced by the binding and insertion of the peptide."

HGFs treated with plasma for 3 min migrate to each other across the gap faster than those in the control and 5-min treatment groups on days 1 and 3. The plasma-treated HGFs show significantly high expression levels of the cell cycle arrest-related p21 gene and enhanced MMP activity. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediated attenuation of wound healing or actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and plasma-mediated reversal of this attenuation support the migratory effect of DBD-NBP. Further, this work performs computer simulations to investigate the effect of oxidation on the stability and conformation of the catalytic kinase domain (KD) of FAK. It is found that the oxidation of highly reactive amino acids (AAs) Cys427, Met442, Cys559, Met571, Met617, and Met643 changes the conformation and increases the structural flexibility of the FAK protein and thus modulates its function and activity. Low-dose DBD-NBP-induces host cell cycle arrest, ECM breakdown, and subsequent migration, thus contributing to the enhanced wound healing process.
A novel phosphotriesterase was recently discovered and purified from Sphingobium sp. TCM1 (Sb-PTE) and shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of organophosphate esters with a catalytic efficiency that exceeds 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) for the hydrolysis of triphenyl phosphate. The enzyme was crystallized and the three-dimensional structure determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Protein Data Bank entry 5HRM ). The enzyme adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller protein fold, and three disulfide bonds were identified between Cys-146 and Cys-242, Cys-411 and Cys-443, and Cys-542 and Cys-559. The active site of Sb-PTE contains a binuclear manganese center that is nearly identical to that of the structurally unrelated phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta (Pd-PTE). The two metal ions in the active site are bridged to one another by Glu-201 and a water molecule. The α-metal ion is further coordinated to the protein by interactions with His-389, His-475, and Glu-407, whereas the β-metal ion is further liganded to His-317 and His-258. Computational docking of mimics of the proposed pentavalent reaction intermediates for the hydrolysis of organophosphates was used to provide a model for the binding of chiral substrates in the active site of Sb-PTE. The most striking difference in the catalytic properties of Sb-PTE, relative to those of Pd-PTE, is the enhanced rate of hydrolysis of organophosphate esters with substantially weaker leaving groups. The structural basis for this difference in the catalytic properties between Sb-PTE and Pd-PTE, despite the nearly identical binuclear metal centers for the activation of the substrate and nucleophilic water molecule, is at present unclear.
Mercuric ion reductase (MerA) catalyzes the reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) as the last step in the bacterial mercury detoxification pathway. A member of the flavin disulfide oxidoreductase family, MerA contains an FAD prosthetic group and redox-active disulfide in its active site. However, the presence of these two moieties is not sufficient for catalytic Hg(II) reduction, as other enzyme family members are potently inhibited by mercurials. We have previously identified a second pair of active site cysteines (Cys558 Cys559 in the Tn501 enzyme) unique to MerA, that are essential for high levels of mercuric ion reductase activity [Moore, M. J., & Walsh, C. T. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1183; Miller, S. M., et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1194]. In this paper, we have examined the individual roles of Cys558 and Cys559 by site-directed mutagenesis of each to alanine. Phenotypic analysis indicates that both merA mutations result in a total disruption of the Hg(II) detoxification pathway in vivo, while characterization of the purified mutant enzymes in vitro shows each to have differential effects on catalytic function. Compared to wild-type enzyme, the C558A mutant shows a 20-fold reduction in kcat and a 10-fold increase in Km, for an overall decrease in catalytic efficiency of 200-fold in kcat/Km. In contrast, mutation of Cys559 to alanine results in less than a 2-fold reduction in kcat and an increase in Km of only 4-5 fold for an overall decrease in catalytic efficiency of only ca. 10-fold in vitro. From these results, it appears that Cys558 plays a more important role in forming the reducible complex with Hg(II), while both Cys558 and Cys559 seem to be involved in efficient scavenging (i.e., tight binding) of Hg(II).
Mercuric reductase catalyzes the two-electron reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) using NADPH as the reductant; this reaction constitutes the molecular basis for detoxification of Hg(II) by bacteria. The enzyme is an alpha 2 homodimer and possesses two pairs of cysteine residues, Cys135 and Cys140 (redox-active pair) and Cys558 and Cys559 (C-terminal pair), which are known to be essential for catalysis. In the present study, we have obtained evidence for an intersubunit active site, consisting of a redox-active cysteine pair from one subunit and a C-terminal pair from the adjacent subunit, by reconstituting catalytic activity both in vivo and in vitro starting with two inactive, mutant enzymes, Ala135Ala140Cys558Cys559 (AACC) and Cys135Cys140Ala558Ala559 (CCAA). Genetic complementation studies were used to show that coexpression of AACC and CCAA in the same cell yielded an HgR phenotype, some 10(4)-fold more resistant than cells expressing only one mutant. Purification and catalytic characterization of a similarly coexpressed protein mixture showed the mixture to have activity levels ca. 25% those of wild type; this is the same as that statistically anticipated for a CCAA-AACC heterodimeric/homodimeric mixture with only one functional active site per heterodimer. Actual physical evidence for the formation of active mutant heterodimers was obtained by chaotrope-induced subunit interchange of inactive pure CCAA and AACC homodimers in vitro followed by electrophoretic separation of heterodimers from homodimers. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that the active site in mercuric reductase resides at the subunit interface and contains cysteine residues originating from separate polypeptide chains.
Mercuric reductase, with FAD and a reducible disulfide at the active site, catalyzes the two-electron reduction of Hg(II) by NADPH. Addition of reducing equivalents rapidly produces a spectrally distinct EH2 form of the enzyme containing oxidized FAD and reduced active site thiols. Formation of EH2 has previously been reported to require only 2 electrons for reduction of the active site disulfide. We present results of anaerobic titrations of mercuric reductase with NADPH and dithionite showing that the equilibrium conversion of oxidized enzyme to EH2 actually requires 2 equiv of reducing agent or 4 electrons. Kinetic studies conducted both at 4 degrees C and at 25 degrees C indicate that reduction of the active site occurs rapidly, as previously reported [Sahlman, L., & Lindskog, S. (1983) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 117, 231-237]; this is followed by a slower reduction of another redox group via reaction with the active site. Thiol titrations of denatured Eox and EH2 enzyme forms show that an additional disulfide is the group in communication with the active site. [14C]Iodoacetamide labeling experiments demonstrate that the C-terminal residues, Cys558 and Cys559, are involved in this disulfide. The fluorescence, but not the absorbance, of the enzyme-bound FAD was found to be highly dependent on the redox state of the C-terminal thiols. Thus, Eox with Cys558 and Cys559 as thiols exhibits less than 50% of the fluorescence of Eox where these residues are present as a disulfide, indicating that the thiols remain intimately associated with the active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a rate-limiting enzyme in serine biogenesis, exhibits hyperactivity across multiple tumors and emerges as a promising target for cancer treatment. Through screening our in-house compound library, we identified compound Stattic as a potent PHGDH inhibitor (IC50 = 1.98 ± 0.66 µM). Subsequent exploration in structural activity relationships led to the discovery of compound B12 that demonstrated the increased enzymatic inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.29 ± 0.02 μM). Furthermore, B12 exhibited robust inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MDA-MB-468, NCI-H1975, HT1080 and PC9 cells that overexpress PHGDH. Additionally, using a [U-13C6]-glucose tracing assay, B12 was found to reduce the production of glucose-derived serine in MDA-MB-468 cells. Finally, mass spectrometry-based peptide profiling, mutagenesis experiment and molecular docking study collectively suggested that B12 formed a covalent bond with Cys421 of PHGDH.
Despite successful clinical application of non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma (APP), the details of the molecular mechanisms underlying APP-inducible biological responses remain ill-defined. We previously reported that exposure of 3T3L1 cells to APP-irradiated buffer raised the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) concentration by eliciting Ca2+ influx in a manner sensitive to transient receptor potential (TRP) channel inhibitors. However, the precise identity of the APP-responsive channel molecule(s) remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to clarify channel molecule(s) responsible for indirect APP-responsive [Ca2+]i rises. siRNA-mediated silencing experiments revealed that TRPA1 and TRPV1 serve as the major APP-responsive Ca2+ channels in 3T3L1 cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of either TRPA1 or TRPV1 in APP-unresponsive C2C12 cells actually triggered [Ca2+]i elevation in response to indirect APP exposure. Desensitization experiments using 3T3L1 cells revealed APP responsiveness to be markedly suppressed after pretreatment with allyl isothiocyanate or capsaicin, TRPA1 and TRPV1 agonists, respectively. APP exposure also desensitized the cells to these chemical agonists, indicating the existence of a bi-directional heterologous desensitization property of APP-responsive [Ca2+]i transients mediated through these TRP channels. Mutational analyses of key cysteine residues in TRPA1 (Cys421, Cys621, Cys641, and Cys665) and in TRPV1 (Cys258, Cys363, and Cys742) have suggested that multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are intricately involved in activation of the channels via a broad range of modifications involving these cysteine residues. Taken together, these observations allow us to conclude that both TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels play a pivotal role in evoking indirect APP-dependent [Ca2+]i responses.
Mass spectrometry was used to investigate the effects of exposing mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) to the membrane lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxy-2-(E)-nonenal (HNE). ACO2 was selected for this study because (1) it is known to be inactivated by HNE, (2) elevated concentrations of HNE-adducted ACO2 have been associated with disease states, (3) extensive structural information is available, and (4) the iron-sulfur cluster in ACO2 offers a critical target for HNE adduction. The aim of this study was to relate the inactivation of ACO2 by HNE to structural features. Initially, Western blotting and an enzyme activity assay were used to assess aggregate effects and then gel electrophoresis, in-gel digestion, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were used to identify HNE addition sites. HNE addition reaction rates were determined for the most significant sites using the iTRAQ approach. The most reactive sites were Cys(358), Cys(421), and Cys(424), the three iron-sulfur cluster-coordinating cysteines, Cys(99), the closest non-ligated cysteine to the cluster, and Cys(565), which is located in the cleft leading to the active site. Interestingly, both enzyme activity assay and iTRAQ relative abundance plots appeared to be trending toward horizontal asymptotes, rather than completion.
TRPA1 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family, and is predominantly expressed in nociceptive neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia. Activation of TRPA1 by environmental irritants such as mustard oil, allicin and acrolein causes acute pain. However, the endogenous ligands that directly activate TRPA1 remain elusive in inflammation. Here, we show that a variety of inflammatory mediators (15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and proton (H(+))) activate human TRPA1 heterologously expressed in HEK cells. These inflammatory mediators induced robust Ca(2+) influx in a subset of mouse DRG neurons. The TRP channel blocker ruthenium red almost completely inhibited neuronal responses by 15d-PGJ(2) and NO, but partially suppressed responses to H(2)O(2) and H(+). Functional characterization of site-directed cysteine mutants of TRPA1 in combination with labeling experiments using biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2) demonstrated that modifications of cytoplasmic N-terminal cysteines (Cys421 and Cys621) were responsible for the activation of TRPA1 by 15d-PGJ(2). In TRPA1 responses to other cysteine-reactive inflammatory mediators, such as NO and H(2)O(2), the extent of impairment by respective cysteine mutations differed from those in TRPA1 responses to 15d-PGJ(2). Interestingly, the Cys421 mutation critically impaired the TRPA1 response to H(+) as well. Our findings suggest that TRPA1 channels are targeted by an array of inflammatory mediators to elicit inflammatory pain in the nervous system.
Glycopeptides derived from a lysylendopeptidase digest of commercially available human transferrin were analyzed by nano-flow liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS), which permitted the carbohydrate profiles at Asn432 and Asn630 to be determined. Both are located in a well-known motif for N-glycosylation, Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr. The contents of the carbohydrates at each site were significantly different from each other, and consisted of a variety of minor types of oligosaccharides in addition to the major one, a biantennary complex-type oligosaccharide. Nano-flow ESI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of the glycopeptides (Cys421-Lys433 and Ile619-Lys646) containing these two sites yielded predominantly ions originating from the non-reducing termini (oxonium ions) and reducing terminus, resulting from cleavage of the glycosidic bonds of the carbohydrate moieties; this permitted the structural read-out of a small minority of the carbohydrate moieties. In particular, the observation of oxonium ions at m/z 512.2 and 803.2 is useful for probing outer non-reducing terminal fucosylation, which represented carbohydrate structures consisting of Hex, dHex, and HexNAc, and NeuNAc, Hex, dHex, and HexNAc, respectively, from which the Lewis X structure (Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc) was readily deduced. Moreover, fucosylation at the reducing-terminal GlcNAc (Fucalpha1-6GlcNAc) specifically occurred at Asn630, as demonstrated by treatment of the glycopeptides with alpha1-3/4-L-fucosidase."

ADAMTSL4 mutations seem to be the most common cause of isolated ectoplia lentis (EL) and thus are important concerning the differential diagnosis of connective tissue syndromes with EL as main feature. In this study, we describe an additional cohort of patients with apparently isolated EL. All underwent a detailed clinical exam with cardiac evaluation combined with ADAMTSL4 mutation analysis. Mutations were identified in 12/15 patients with EL. Besides the European founder mutation p. (Gln256Profs*38) we identified five further mutations not yet described in the literature: p. (Leu249Tyrfs*21), p. (Ala388Glyfs*8), p. (Arg746His), p. (Gly592Ser), and p. (Arg865His). Clinical evaluation showed common additional ocular features such as high myopia, but no major systemic findings. In particular: no dilatation of the aortic root was reported on. This report increases the total number of patients with ADAMTSL4 mutations reported on today and reviews in detail the clinical findings in all patients reported on to date demonstrate, that these patients have a mainly ocular phenotype. There are no consistent systemic findings. The differentiation between syndromic and isolated EL is crucial for the further surveillance, treatment, and counseling of these patients, especially in young children."

The main challenge for the study of Type I interferonopathies is the lack of a well-founded animal model to better characterize the phenotype as well as to perform fast and large drug screenings to offer the best treatment options. In this study, we report the development of a transgenic zebrafish model of Type I interferonopathy overexpressing ifih1 carrying the mutation p.Arg742His (Tg(ifih1_mut)), corresponding to the human mutation p.Arg779His. RNA sequence analysis from Tg(ifih1_mut) larvae revealed a systemic inflammation and IFN signature upon a suboptimal poly I:C induction compared with wild-type larvae, confirming the phenotype observed in patients suffering from Type I interferonopathies. More interestingly, the phenotype was manifested in the zebrafish inflammation and Type I IFN reporters nfkb:eGFP and isg15:eGFP, respectively, making this zebrafish model suitable for future high-throughput chemical screening (HTS). Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model for gene editing, we have generated Tg(ifih1_mut) knocked down for mavs and ikbke, which completely abrogated the Poly I:C induction and activation of the GFP of the reporters. Finally, we used an FDA-approved drug, Baricitinib (Jak1/Jak2 inhibitor), which was able to reduce the inflammation and the ISG expression. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model to further understand AGS pathological mechanisms and to identify novel therapeutic drugs by HTS."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24849604/","With no lysine 4 (WNK4) is a serine/threonine kinase, which is expressed in the kidney and associated with salt-sensitive hypertension. However, how salt regulates WNK4 remains unclear. In the present study, the C57BL/6 mice and HEK293 cells were treated with high salt and the expression of WNK4 protein and its ubiquitination and phosphorylation levels were detected. Western blotting demonstrated that WNK4 expression was significantly increased in high salt-treated mice and cells. Meanwhile, co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the ubiquitination of WNK4 was decreased under high-salt simulation. It was also identified that the Lys-1023 site was the most important ubiquitination site for WNK4, and it was found that phosphorylation at the Ser-1022 site was a prerequisite for ubiquitination. These results suggested that there was crosstalk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination in the WNK4 protein, and high salt may downregulate its phosphorylation and, in turn, decrease its ubiquitination, leading to a decrease in WNK4 degradation. This eventually resulted in an increase in the abundance of WNK4 protein.
The neuron-specific cation chloride cotransporter KCC2 plays a crucial role in hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition. Transporter dysfunction is associated with various neurological disorders, raising interest in regulatory mechanisms. Phosphorylation has been identified as a key regulatory process. Here, we retrieved experimentally observed phosphorylation sites of KCC2 from public databases and report on the systematic analysis of six phosphorylated serines, Ser(25), Ser(26), Ser(937), Ser(1022), Ser(1025), and Ser(1026). Alanine or aspartate substitutions of these residues were analyzed in HEK-293 cells. All mutants were expressed in a pattern similar to wild-type KCC2 (KCC2(WT)). Tl(+) flux measurements demonstrated unchanged transport activity for Ser(25), Ser(26), Ser(1022), Ser(1025), and Ser(1026) mutants. In contrast, KCC2(S937D), mimicking phosphorylation, resulted in a significant up-regulation of transport activity. Aspartate substitution of Thr(934), a neighboring putative phosphorylation site, resulted in a comparable increase in KCC2 transport activity. Both KCC2(T934D) and KCC2(S937D) mutants were inhibited by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and by N-ethylmaleimide, whereas KCC2(WT), KCC2(T934A), and KCC2(S937A) were activated. The inverse staurosporine effect on aspartate versus alanine substitutions reveals a cross-talk between different phosphorylation sites of KCC2. Immunoblot and cell surface labeling experiments detected no alterations in total abundance or surface expression of KCC2(T934D) and KCC2(S937D) compared with KCC2(WT). These data reveal kinetic regulation of transport activity by these residues. In summary, our data identify a novel key regulatory phosphorylation site of KCC2 and a functional interaction between different conformation-changing post-translational modifications. The action of pharmacological agents aimed to modulate KCC2 activity for therapeutic benefit might therefore be highly context-specific."

We discovered that a noncanonical activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by PKA is required for the βAR-stimulation of adipose tissue browning. However, the downstream events triggered by PKA-phosphorylated mTORC1 activation that drive this thermogenic response are not well understood.
The adaptor protein raptor is the functional identifier for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), acting to target mTOR to specific substrates for phosphorylation and regulation. Using HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we confirmed the phosphorylation of raptor at Ser696, Thr706, Ser721, Ser722, Ser855, Ser859, Ser863, Thr865, Ser877, Ser881, Ser883, and Ser884 and identified Tyr692, Ser699, Thr700, Ser704, Ser854, Ser857, Ser882, Ser886, Ser887, and Thr889 as new, previously unidentified raptor phosphorylation sites. Treatment of cells with insulin increased the phosphorylation of raptor at Ser696, Ser855, Ser863, and Thr865 and suppressed the phosphorylation of Ser722. Ser696 phosphorylation was insensitive to mTOR inhibition with rapamycin, whereas treatment of cells with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of raptor at Ser696. In vitro incubation of raptor with p42 MAPK significantly increased raptor phosphorylation (P < 0.01), whereas phosphorylation of a Ser696Ala mutant was decreased (P < 0.05), suggesting MAPK is capable of directly phosphorylating raptor at Ser696. Mutation of Ser696 to alanine interfered with insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream substrate p70S6 kinase. Incubation of cells with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin decreased the insulin stimulated phosphorylation of raptor, suggesting that the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways may merge at mTORC1.
Ligand-dependent interaction of nuclear receptors and coactivators is a critical step in nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation. TR-binding protein (TRBP) interacts with nuclear receptors through a single LXXLL motif. Evidence suggested that the sequences flanking the LXXLL motif in a number of coactivators determine receptor selectivity. We performed mutagenesis studies at residues adjacent to the TRBP LXXLL motif and identified S884 of TRBP at the -3 position of the LXXLL motif as a key residue for receptor selectivity. Analysis of in vitro and in vivo receptor interactions with TRBP suggested that S884 allowed selective interactions for ERbeta, TR, and RXR vs. ERalpha. Transient transfection studies further confirmed that the LXXLL-binding affinity correlates with TRBP transcriptional activity. Consistent with the structural modeling, an E380G substitution within ERalpha altered the binding to TRBP mutants, demonstrating the direct contact between TRBP S884 and ERalpha E380, which is a residue that distinguishes receptor subclasses. Furthermore, S884 can be phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro, an event that significantly altered the binding of TRBP to ER and suggests a potential mechanism for regulatory interaction. As the differential recruitment of TRBP to ERalpha and ERbeta may rely on S884, our finding provides insight into estrogen signaling and may lead to the development of therapeutic receptor-selective peptide antagonists."

Analysis of translated polypeptides revealed 21 amino acid positions typical of this group of strains and distinguishing them from the other tickborne encephalitis virus strains of Far Eastern subtype examined earlier. Only three mutations led to substantial amino acid changes, which probably could affect the infection process severity. It is suggested that two associated mutations, deletion of amino acid 111 in the capsid protein C and substitution (Ser1534 --> Phe) in the NS3 protein influence strictly coordinated polyprotein processing, disturbing correct arrangement of viral particles. This process can result in the development of defect viral particles, containing no RNA. Mutation (Ser917 --> Gly) in nonstructural protein NS1 results in the substitution of hydrophilic amino acid, specific to highly virulent strains, by the hydrophobic one. This could influence the effectiveness of viral replication complex, thereby affecting the infectivity of tick-borne encephalitis virus strains."

This study reports a novel, highly stable keratinase from Bacillus pacificus RSA27 for the production of pure peptides rich in essential amino acids from chicken feathers. Purified keratinase showed a specific activity of 38.73 U/mg, 2.58-fold purification, and molecular weight of 36 kDa. Kinetic studies using a chicken feather as substrate report K m and V max values of 5.69 mg/ml and 142.40 μg/ml/min, respectively, suggesting significant enzyme-substrate affinity/biocatalysis. Identification and in silico structural-functional analysis of keratinase discovered the presence of distinct amino acid residues and their positions. Besides, keratinase possesses a high-affinity calcium-binding site (Asp128, Leu162, Asn164, Ile166, and Val168) and a catalytic triad of Asp119, His151, and Ser308, known attributes of serine protease (subtilisin family). Furthermore, a scale-up to 5 L fermenter revealed complete feather hydrolysis (94.5%) within 24 h with high activity (789 U/ml) and total amino acid of 153.97 μmol/ml. Finally, cytotoxicity evaluation of protein hydrolysate resulted in negligible cytotoxic effects (1.02%) on the mammalian hepatoblastoma cell line, signifying its potential biotechnological applications.
Previous studies found that the activity of Sortase A, a bacterial surface protein from Staphylococcus aureus, was inhibited by curcumin and its analogues. To explore this inhibitory mechanism, Sortase A and its inhibitors in complex systems were studied by molecular docking, molecular modelling, binding energy decomposition calculation and steered molecular dynamics simulations. Energy decomposition analysis indicated that PRO-163, LEU-169, GLN-172, ILE-182 and ILE-199 are key residues in Sortase A-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, interactions between the methoxyl group on the benzene ring in the conjugated molecule (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin) and VAL-168, LEU-169 and GLN-172 induce the inhibitory activity based on the energy decomposition and distance analyses between the whole residues and inhibitors. However, because of its coiled structure, the non-conjugated molecule, tetrahydrocurcumin, with key residues in the binding sites of Sortase A, interacted weakly with SrtA, leading to the loss of inhibitory activity. Based on these results, the methoxyl group on the benzene ring in the conjugated molecule largely influenced the inhibitory activity of the Sortase A inhibitors.
Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus) resistance, considered a dilemma for the clinical treatment of this bacterial infection, is becoming increasingly intractable. Novel anti-virulence strategies will undoubtedly provide a path forward in combating these resistant bacterial infections. Sortase A (SrtA), an enzyme responsible for anchoring virulence-related surface proteins, and alpha-hemolysin (Hla), a pore-forming cytotoxin, have aroused great scientific interest, as they have been regarded as targets for promising agents against S. aureus infection. In this study, we discovered that chalcone, a natural small compound with little anti-S. aureus activity, could significantly inhibit SrtA activity with an IC50 of 53.15 μM and Hla hemolysis activity with an IC50 of 17.63 μM using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay and a hemolysis assay, respectively. In addition, chalcone was proven to reduce protein A (SpA) display in intact bacteria, binding to fibronectin, formation of biofilm and S. aureus invasion. Chalcone could down-regulate the transcriptional levels of the hla gene and the agrA gene, thus leading to a reduction in the expression of Hla and significant protection against Hla-mediated A549 cell injury; more importantly, chalcone could also reduce mortality in infected mice. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis assays were used to identify the mechanism of chalcone against SrtA, which implied that the inhibitory activity lies in the bond between chalcone and SrtA residues Val168, Ile182, and Arg197. Taken together, the in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that chalcone is a potential novel therapeutic compound for S. aureus infection via targeting SrtA and Hla.
A series of novel 2-phenyl-benzo[d]oxazole-7-carboxamide derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A with known Sortase A inhibitor pHMB as positive compound (IC50=130μM). Most compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity (IC50=19.8-184.2μM). Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that substitution at 7-position and 2-position of benzoxazole had great influence on the activities. Specifically, the substituent at 7-position is indispensable for inhibitory activity. The molecular docking studies revealed the i-butyl amide group went towards the β6/β7 loop-β8 substructure of the protein and the benzoxazole core lied in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Ala118, Val166, Val168, Val169 and Ile182, shaping the whole molecule into a L-shape mode to be recognized by Sortase A.
The nucleolar subcompartment of the nucleus is increasingly recognized as an important target of RNA viruses. Here we document for the first time the ability of dengue virus (DENV) polymerase, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), to accumulate within the nucleolus of infected cells and to target green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the nucleolus of live transfected cells. Intriguingly, NS5 exchange between the nucleus and nucleolus is dynamically modulated by extracellular pH, responding rapidly and reversibly to pH change, in contrast to GFP alone or other nucleolar and non-nucleolar targeted protein controls. The minimal pH-sensitive nucleolar targeting region (pHNTR), sufficient to target GFP to the nucleolus in a pH-sensitive fashion, was mapped to NS5 residues 1 to 244, with mutation of key hydrophobic residues, Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168, abolishing pHNTR function in NS5-transfected cells, and severely attenuating DENV growth in infected cells. This is the first report of a viral protein whose nucleolar targeting ability is rapidly modulated by extracellular stimuli, suggesting that DENV has the ability to detect and respond dynamically to the extracellular environment."

To examine ADT components and function in Akebia trifoliata, a representative of Ranunculaceae, we first identified eight ADTs (AktADT1-8, encoding sequences varying from 1032 to 1962 bp) in the A. trifoliata reference genome and five proteins (AktADT1, AktADT4, AktADT7, AktADT8 and AktADT8s) with moonlighting prephenate dehydratase (PDT) activity and Km values varying from 0.43 to 2.17 mM. Structurally, two basic residue combinations (Val314/Ala317 and Ala314/Val317) in the PAC domain are essential for the moonlighting PDT activity of ADTs. Functionally, AktADT4 and AktADT8 successfully restored the wild-type phenotype of pha2, a knockout mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, AktADTs are ubiquitously expressed, but their expression levels are tissue specific, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Phe for AktADTs ranged from 49.81 to 331.17 μM. Both AktADT4 and AktADT8 and AktADT8s localized to chloroplast stromules and the cytosol, respectively, while the remaining AktADTs localized to the chloroplast stroma. These findings suggest that various strategies exist for regulating Phe biosynthesis in A. trifoliata. This provides a reasonable explanation for the high Phe content and insights for further genetic improvement of the edible fruits of A. trifoliata.
Antimalarial drug resistance has thrown a spanner in the works of malaria elimination. New drugs are required for ancillary support of existing malaria control efforts. Plasmodium falciparum requires host glucose for survival and proliferation. On this basis, P. falciparum hexose transporter 1 (PfHT1) protein involved in hexose permeation is considered a potential drug target. In this study, we tested the antimalarial activity of some compounds against PfHT1 using computational techniques. We performed high throughput virtual screening of 21,352 small-molecule compounds against PfHT1. The stability of the lead compound complexes was evaluated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 nanoseconds. We also investigated the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and physiological characteristics of the compounds in accordance with Lipinksi rules for drug-likeness to bind and inhibit PfHT1. Molecular docking and free binding energy analyses were carried out using Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born and Surface Area (MMGBSA) solvation to determine the selectivity of the hit compounds for PfHT1 over the human glucose transporter (hGLUT1) orthologue. Five important PfHT1 inhibitors were identified: Hyperoside (CID5281643); avicularin (CID5490064); sylibin (CID5213); harpagoside (CID5481542) and quercetagetin (CID5281680). The compounds formed intermolecular interaction with the binding pocket of the PfHT1 target via conserved amino acid residues (Val314, Gly183, Thr49, Asn52, Gly183, Ser315, Ser317, and Asn48). The MMGBSA analysis of the complexes yielded high free binding energies. Four (CID5281643, CID5490064, CID5213, and CID5481542) of the identified compounds were found to be stable within the PfHT1 binding pocket throughout the 100 nanoseconds simulation run time. The four compounds demonstrated higher affinity for PfHT1 than the human major glucose transporter (hGLUT1). This investigation demonstrates the inhibition potential of sylibin, hyperoside, harpagoside, and avicularin against PfHT1 receptor. Robust preclinical investigations are required to validate the chemotherapeutic properties of the identified compounds.
Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a vascular malformation characterized by abnormally enlarged capillary cavities without any intervening neural tissue. We report 2 cases of familial CCMs diagnosed with the CCM1 mutation by using a genetic assay. A 5-year-old boy presented with headache, vomiting, and seizure-like movements. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple CCM lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. Subsequent mutation analysis of his father and other family members revealed c.940_943 del (p.Val314 Asn315delinsThrfsX3) mutations of the CCM1 gene. A 10-month-old boy who presented with seizure-like movements was reported to have had no perinatal event. His aunt was diagnosed with cerebral angioma. Brain and spine MRI revealed multiple angiomas in the cerebral hemisphere and thoracic spinal cord. Mutation analysis of his father was normal, although that of the patient and his mother revealed c.535C>T (p.Arg179X) mutations of the CCM1 gene. Based on these studies, we suggest that when a child with a familial history of CCMs exhibits neurological symptoms, the physician should suspect familial CCMs and consider brain imaging or a genetic assay.
Calcineurin (CN) is the target of the immunophilin-immunosuppressant complex, cyclophilin/cyclosporin A (CyP/CsA). RCAN1 has recently been shown to be an endogenous regulator of CN activity. We determined the enzymatic and thermodynamic aspects of CN inhibition by RCAN1. The IC50 values of isoforms RCAN1-1L and RCAN1-4 for CN were 2.7 μM and 2.6 μM, respectively. Two deletions in the CN catalytic subunit, one a deletion of Val314 in the Loop7 domain (ΔV314) and the other in the autoinhibitory domain (CNAabc), increased the sensitivity of CN to inhibition by RCAN1-1L. The IC50s of RCAN1-1L and RCAN1-4 for CN in homogenates of mouse brain were 141 nM and 100 nM, respectively. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we found that the RCAN1-1L/CN or CyP/CsA/CN interactions were exothermic with a dissociation constant of 0.46 μM or 0.17 μM, respectively. Our ITC results show that the interactions between CN and its two inhibitors were both characterized by a favorable binding enthalpy change. We also confirmed that overexpression of RCAN1-1L could inhibit the transcriptional activation of an NFAT-dependent promoter in response to PMA and ionomycin by inhibiting CN activity in HEK293T cells. Our data should contribute to our understanding of the regulation of CN activity by endogenous inhibitors.
Calcineurin (CN) is the receptor for two immunophilin-immunosuppressant complexes, Cyp-CsA and FKBP-FK506. It is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (CNA) and a regulatory subunit (CNB). It is also inhibited by its own auto-inhibitory domain (AID). Loop 7 is a beta-hairpin within CNA that makes close contact with bound immunophilin-immunosuppressant complexes and with the AID. To investigate the role of Loop 7 in inhibition, we generated a series of deletion and substitution mutants and examined their inhibition by Cyp-CsA, FKBP-FK506 and an AID peptide. Our results demonstrate that the contacts made by Loop 7 are critical for its role in CN inhibition. Intriguingly, single residue deletions of Val314 and neighboring residues increased inhibition by FKBP-FK506 >6-fold, whereas they reduced Cyp-CsA inhibition >3-fold and abolished inhibition by the AID peptide. Most of the single substitution mutations also decreased Cyp-CsA inhibition. Loop 7 thus plays different roles in the inhibition of CN by the different inhibitors."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16284723/","Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is a two-domain dipeptidylcarboxypeptidase involved in regulating blood pressure via the kallikrein-kininand renin-angiotensin-aldosterone complex. Therefore, ACE is a key drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular system diseases. At present many works are focus on searching for new inhibitory peptides of ACE to control the blood pressure. In order to exploit the interactions between ACE and its inhibitors, molecular dynamics simulations were used. The results showed that (a) the secondary structures of the three inhibitor-protein complexes did not change significantly; (b) root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values of Leu-Ile-Val-Thr (LIVT)-ACE complexes were significantly higher than that of other systems; (c) the backbone movement of LIVT was vigorous in Asp300-Val350, compared with that in Tyr-Leu-Val-Pro-His (YLVPH) and Tyr-Leu-Val-Arg(YLVR), as shown by the center-of-mass distance; and (d) the backbone movement of Asp300-Val350 may contribute to the interaction between ACE and its inhibitors. Our theoretical results will be helpful to further the design of specific inhibitors of ACE.
Inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a novel strategy for cancer therapy, but only two inhibitors of NAMPT (FK866 and CHS828) have progressed into clinical trials. This study seeks to compare a novel potent NAMPT inhibitor, MS0, with a classical inhibitor FK866 in their biological activity and molecular binding mode, thereby contributing to future chemical optimization and a further understanding of the action mode of NAMPT inhibitors. The IC50 values of MS0 and FK866 in inhibition of recombinant human NAMPT activity were 9.08±0.90 and 1.60±0.32 nmol/L, respectively. Consistently, FK866 exerted better antiproliferation in 6 human cancer cell lines (HepG2, A2780, 95-D, A549, U2OS and U266) than MS0 with IC50 values nearly 12-fold to 225-fold lower than those of MS0. Co-crystal structures of wild-type human NAMPT complexed with MS0 or FK866 were elucidated, which revealed that MS0 did not interact with Ser241. The hydrogen bond mediated by crystallographic water between MS0 and His191 or Val350 of NAMPT did not exist in FK866. Instead, FK866 exhibited hydrophobic interactions with Arg349. Based on the activity assays and crystal structure analyses, we elaborate the reason why the antiproliferation activity of MS0 was not as good as that of FK866, which would contributes to the current understanding of the mode of action of NAMPT inhibitors and will also contribute to further development of anticancer drugs in the future.
Haloferax volcanii Ds-threo-isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was highly expressed in bacteria as inclusion bodies. The recombinant enzyme was refolded, purified and characterized, and was found to be NADP-dependent like the wild-type protein. Sequence alignment of several isocitrate dehydrogenases from evolutionarily divergent organisms including H. volcanii revealed that the amino acid residues involved in coenzyme specificity are highly conserved. Our objective was to switch the coenzyme specificity of halophilic ICDH by altering these conserved amino acids. We were able to switch coenzyme specificity from NADP+ to NAD+ by changing five amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis (Arg291, Lys343, Tyr344, Val350 and Tyr390). The five mutants of ICDH were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and each recombinant ICDH protein was refolded and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Coenzyme specificity did not switch until all five amino acids were substituted."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637956/","The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is a main contributor to global photosynthesis, whilst being limited by iron availability. Cyanobacterial genomes generally encode two different types of FutA iron-binding proteins: periplasmic FutA2 ABC transporter subunits bind Fe(III), while cytosolic FutA1 binds Fe(II). Owing to their small size and their economized genome Prochlorococcus ecotypes typically possess a single futA gene. How the encoded FutA protein might bind different Fe oxidation states was previously unknown. Here, we use structural biology techniques at room temperature to probe the dynamic behavior of FutA. Neutron diffraction confirmed four negatively charged tyrosinates, that together with a neutral water molecule coordinate iron in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Positioning of the positively charged Arg103 side chain in the second coordination shell yields an overall charge-neutral Fe(III) binding state in structures determined by neutron diffraction and serial femtosecond crystallography. Conventional rotation X-ray crystallography using a home source revealed X-ray-induced photoreduction of the iron center with observation of the Fe(II) binding state; here, an additional positioning of the Arg203 side chain in the second coordination shell maintained an overall charge neutral Fe(II) binding site. Dose series using serial synchrotron crystallography and an XFEL X-ray pump-probe approach capture the transition between Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, revealing how Arg203 operates as a switch to accommodate the different iron oxidation states. This switching ability of the Prochlorococcus FutA protein may reflect ecological adaptation by genome streamlining and loss of specialized FutA proteins.
Some probiotics including lactobacilli, colonize host animal cells by targeting glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, located in the extracellular matrix. Recent studies have shown that several lactic acid bacteria degrade GAGs. Here we show the structure/function relationship of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase (KduI) crucial for metabolism of unsaturated glucuronic acid produced through degradation of GAGs. Crystal structures of ligand-free and bound KduIs were determined by X-ray crystallography and the enzyme was found to consist of six identical subunits and adopt a β-helix as a basic scaffold. Ligands structurally similar to the substrate were bound to the cleft of each enzyme subunit. Several residues located in the cleft interacted with ligands through hydrogen bonds and/or C-C contacts. In addition to substrate analogs, a metal ion coordinated to four residues, His198, His200, Glu205, and His248, in the cleft, and the enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by a chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Site-directed mutants in Arg163, Ile165, Thr184, Thr194, His200, Arg203, Tyr207, Met262, and Tyr269 in the cleft exhibited little enzyme activity, indicating that these residues and the metal ion constituted an active site in the cleft. This is the first report on the active site structure of KduI based on the ligand-bound complex.
To date, PACS1-neurodevelopmental disorder (PACS1-NDD) has been associated with recurrent variation of Arg203 and is considered diagnostic of PACS1-NDD, an autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability disorder. Although incompletely defined, the proposed disease mechanism for this variant is altered PACS1 affinity for its client proteins. Given this proposed mechanism, we hypothesized that PACS1 variants that interfere with binding of adaptor proteins might also give rise to syndromic intellectual disability. Herein, we report a proposita and her mother with phenotypic features overlapping PACS1-NDD and a novel PACS1 variant (NM_018026.3:c.[755C > T];[=], p.(Ser252Phe)) that impedes binding of the adaptor protein GGA3 (Golgi-associated, gamma-adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding protein 3). We hypothesize that attenuating PACS1 binding of GGA3 also gives rise to a disorder with features overlapping those of PACS1-NDD. This observation better delineates the mechanism by which PACS1 variation predisposes to syndromic intellectual disability.
Kinesin motor proteins perform several essential cellular functions powered by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis reaction. Several single-point mutations in the kinesin motor protein KIF5A have been implicated to hereditary spastic paraplegia disease (HSP), a lethal neurodegenerative disease in humans. In earlier studies, we have shown that a series of HSP-related mutations can impair the kinesin's long-distance displacement or processivity by modulating the order-disorder transition of the linker connecting the heads to the coiled coil. On the other hand, the reduction of kinesin's ATP hydrolysis reaction rate by a distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is also known to cause HSP disease. However, the molecular mechanism of the ATP hydrolysis reaction in kinesin by this distal mutation is still not fully understood. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations combined with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, the pre-organization geometry required for optimal hydrolysis in kinesin motor bound to α/β-tubulin is determined. This optimal geometry has only a single salt-bridge (of the possible two) between Arg203-Glu236, putting a reactive water molecule at a perfect position for hydrolysis. Such geometry is also needed to create the appropriate configuration for proton translocation during ATP hydrolysis. The distal asparagine-to-serine mutation is found to disrupt this optimal geometry. Therefore, the current study along with our previous one demonstrates how two different effects on kinesin dynamics (processivity and ATP hydrolysis), caused by a different set of genotypes, can give rise to the same phenotype leading to HSP disease.
Previous studies have shown that ELAVL1 plays multiple roles, but its overall biological function remains ill-defined. Here we clearly demonstrated that zebrafish ELAVL1a was a lipoteichoic acid (LTA)- and LPS-binding protein abundantly stored in the eggs/embryos of zebrafish. ELAVL1a acted not only as a pattern recognition receptor, capable of identifying LTA and LPS, as well as bacteria, but also as an effector molecule, capable of inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Furthermore, we reveal that the C-terminal 62 residues of ELAVL1a positioned at 181-242 were indispensable for ELAVL1a antibacterial activity. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the hydrophobic residues Val192/Ile193, as well as the positively charged residues Arg203/Arg204, were the functional determinants contributing to the antimicrobial activity of rELAVL1a. Importantly, microinjection of rELAVL1a into embryos markedly promoted their resistance against pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila challenge, and this pathogen-resistant activity was considerably reduced by co-injection of anti-ELAVL1a antibody or by knockdown with morpholino for elavl1a. Collectively, our results indicate that ELAVL1a is a maternal immune factor that can protect zebrafish embryos from bacterial infection. This work also provides another angle for understanding the biological roles of ELAVL1a."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23286827/","The CYP450 enzyme is a superfamily enzyme ubiquitously found in nearly all organisms, playing a vital role in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous compounds, and in biosynthesis. Unfortunately, an understanding of its classification, functions, expression characteristics, and other biological traits in Hyalomma asiaticum, a vector for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, as well as of the genes implicated in its natural product metabolism, is lacking. Towards this end, this study has identified 120 H. asiaticum CYP450 genes via transcriptome data in the face of a joint genome threat from terpinolene. The proteins these genes encode are of higher molecular weight, devoid of a signal peptide, and composed of unstable hydrophobic proteins principally containing 1-3 variable transmembrane regions. Phylogenetic evolution classifies these H. asiaticum CYP450 genes into four subfamilies. These genes all encompass complete CYP450 conserved domains, and five specific conserved motifs, albeit with different expression levels. GO and KEGG annotation findings suggest a widespread distribution of these CYP450 genes in many physiological systems, predominantly facilitating lipid metabolism, terpenoid compound metabolism, and polyketone compound metabolism, as well as cofactor and vitamin metabolism at a cellular level. Molecular docking results reveal a hydrophobic interaction between the ARG-103, ARG-104, LEU-106, PHE-109, and ILE-119 amino acid residues in CYP3A8, which is primarily expressed in the fat body, and terpinolene, with a notably up-regulated expression, with affinity = -5.6 kcal/mol. The conservation of these five key amino acid residues varies across 12 tick species, implying differences in terpinolene metabolism efficacy among various tick species. This study thereby fills an existing knowledge gap regarding the biological characteristics of H. asiaticum CYP450 genes and paves the way for further research into the functions of these particular genes.
Background Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is caused by a single-stranded RNA genome. Vaccination is currently the most effective method for preventing rubella and its complications. Molecular docking, a computer-based technique used in drug discovery and development, is used to investigate the interactions between potential drug candidates and their target proteins. It predicts the binding interactions between small molecules (ligands) and the target protein. In this study, we examined a marine-derived drug from Rhizophora mucronata for its potential antiviral properties against the rubella capsid virus. Our objective was to identify the active inhibitory sites of the capsid virus. Materials and methods Protein and ligand molecules were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and PubChem databases. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to calculate molecular docking using Autodock Tools 1.5.7. The docking parameters used for each docked molecule were determined from 100 separate docking experiments with a maximum of 2.5×10-6 energy and a mutation rate of 2.0 and mass over ratio of 0.8. The results were recorded as docking parameter files (DPF). PyMOL was used to view and investigate the interactions between ligand fragments and rubella capsid protein. Results This approach plays a crucial role in the development of structure-based drugs. The results of the molecular docking suggest that Rhizophorin has the potential to bind with the rubella capsid protein. The strong binding affinity of -6.05 kcal/mol between the ligand and the protein further supports the potential of Rhizophorin as a therapeutic agent. The formation of hydrogen bonds between the ligand and amino acid residues Glu79, Arg82, and Thr118 indicates the significance of electrostatic interactions in the binding process. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and residues Ala81, Val84, Leu87, and Ile119 suggest the role of non-polar interactions in stabilizing the complex. The identified amino acid residues involved in these binding interactions could serve as potential targets for drug development. In future studies, experimental validation of the predicted interactions could provide further insights into the potential of Rhizophorin as an antiviral agent. Conclusion According to the findings of this study, the in silico investigation successfully identified a target for inhibiting the rubella virus (RuV) capsid receptor molecule. Future investigations on these compounds will require in vitro and in vivo studies using models that are more relevant to the medicinal potential of the capsid protein molecule.
To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) by which herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein UL51 promotes viral replication, we screened for viral proteins that interact with UL51 in infected cells. Affinity purification of tagged UL51 in HSV-1-infected Vero cells was coupled with immunoblotting of the purified UL51 complexes with various antibodies to HSV-1 virion proteins. Subsequent analyses revealed that UL51 interacted with another tegument protein, UL14, in infected cells. Mutational analyses of UL51 showed that UL51 amino acid residues Leu-111, Ile-119, and Tyr-123 were required for interaction with UL14 in HSV-1-infected cells. Alanine substitutions of these UL51 amino acid residues reduced viral replication and produced an accumulation of unenveloped and partially enveloped nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm at levels comparable to those of UL51-null, UL14-null, and UL51/UL14 double-null mutations. In addition, although UL51 and UL14 colocalized at juxtanuclear domains in HSV-1-infected cells, the amino acid substitutions in UL51 produced aberrant localization of UL51 and UL14. The effects of these substitutions on localization of UL51 and UL14 were similar to those of the UL51-null and UL14-null mutations on localization of UL14 and UL51, respectively. These results suggested that the interaction between UL51 and UL14 was required for proper localization of these viral proteins in infected cells and that the UL51-UL14 complex regulated final viral envelopment for efficient viral replication.
The O2-binding carboxylate-bridged diiron site in DcrH-Hr was engineered in an effort to perform the H2O2-dependent oxidation of external substrates.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10655481/","The crystal structure of viral infectivity factor (Vif) was reported recently, which makes it possible to design new inhibitors against Vif by structure-based drug design. Through analysis of the protein surface of Vif, the C2 pocket located in the N-terminal was found, which is suit for developing small molecular inhibitors. Then, in our article, fragment-based virtual screening (FBVS) was conducted and a series of fragments was obtained, among which, Zif-1 bearing indole scaffold and pyridine ring can form H-bonds with Tyr148 and Ile155. Subsequently, 19 derivatives of Zif-1 were synthesized. Through the immune-fluorescence staining and Western blot assays, Zif-15 shows potent activity in inhibiting Vif-mediated A3G degradation. Further docking experiment shows that Zif-15 form H-bond interactions with residues His139, Tyr148 and Ile155. Therefore, Zif-15 is a promising lead compound against Vif that can be used to treat AIDS.
To investigate the molecular mechanism of chloroplast biogenesis and development, we characterized an Arabidopsis mutant (dg169, delayed greening 169) which showed growth retardation and delayed greening phenotype in leaves. Newly emerged chlorotic leaves recovered gradually with leaf development in the mutant, and the mature leaves showed similar phenotype to those of wild-typewild-type plants. Compared with wild-type, the chloroplasts were oval-shaped and smaller and the thylakoid membranes were less abundant in yellow section of young leaves of dg169. In addition, the functions of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) were also impaired. Furthermore, the amount of core subunits of PSII and PSI, as well as PSII and PSI complexes reduced in yellow section of young leaves of dg169. Map-based positional cloning identified that phenotype of dg169 was attributed to a point mutation of ATase2 which converts the conserved Ile-155 residue to Asn. ATase2 catalyzes the first step of de novo purine biosynthesis. This mutation resulted in impaired purine synthesis and a significant decrease in ATP, ADP, GTP and GDP contents. The analysis of ATase2-GFP protein fusion showed that ATase2 was localized to nucleoid of chloroplasts. Our results further demonstrated that the levels of PEP-dependent transcripts in yellow section of young leaves of dg169 were decreased while NEP-dependent and both PEP- and NEP-dependent transcripts and chloroplast DNA replications were increased. The results in this study suggest that ATase2 plays an essential role in early chloroplast development through maintaining PEP function.
The superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase in phagocytes is crucial for host defence; its catalytic core is the membrane-integrated protein gp91phox [also known as Nox2 (NADPH oxidase 2)], which forms a stable heterodimer with p22phox. Activation of the oxidase requires membrane translocation of the three cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox and the small GTPase Rac. At the membrane, these proteins assemble with the gp91phox-p22phox heterodimer and induce a conformational change of gp91phox, leading to superoxide production. p47phox translocates to membranes using its two tandemly arranged SH3 domains, which directly interact with p22phox, whereas p67phox is recruited in a p47phox-dependent manner. In the present study, we show that a short region N-terminal to the bis-SH3 domain is required for activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Alanine substitution for Ile152 in this region, a residue that is completely conserved during evolution, results in a loss of the ability to activate the oxidase; and the replacement of Thr153 also prevents oxidase activation, but to a lesser extent. In addition, the corresponding isoleucine residue (Ile155) of the p47phox homologue Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) participates in the activation of non-phagocytic oxidases, such as Nox1 and Nox3. The I152A substitution in p47phox, however, does not affect its interaction with p22phox or with p67phox. Consistent with this, a mutant p47phox (I152A), as well as the wild-type protein, is targeted upon cell stimulation to membranes, and membrane recruitment of p67phox and Rac normally occurs in p47phox (I152A)-expressing cells. Thus the Ile152-containing region of p47phox plays a crucial role in oxidase activation, probably by functioning at a process after oxidase assembly.
One of the necessary conditions for a protein to be foldable is the presence of a complete set of folding elements (FEs) that are short contiguous peptide segments distributed over an amino acid sequence. Previous studies indicated the FE assembly model of protein folding, in which the FEs interact with each other and coalesce to form an intermediate(s) early in the folding reaction. This suggests that a clue to the understanding of the determinants of protein foldability can be found by investigating how the FEs interact with each other early in the folding and thereby elucidating roles of the FEs in protein folding. To reveal the formation process of FE-FE interactions, we studied the early folding events of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) utilizing systematic sequence perturbation analysis. Here, systematic single amino acid substitutions were introduced inside of the FEs (W30X in FE2, V40X in FE3, N59X in FE4, and I155X in FE10; X refers to various amino acid residues), and their kinetic refolding reactions were measured by stopped-flow circular dichroism and fluorescence. We show that the interactions around Trp30 and Ile155 are formed in the burst phase intermediate, while those around Val40 and Asn59 are formed in the transition state of the subsequent folding phase (tau5-phase) and in much later processes, respectively. These and previous results suggest that FE2 and FE10, and also FE1 and FE7, involved in the loop subdomain of DHFR, interact with each other within a millisecond time range, while the stable FE3-FE4 interactions are formed in the later processes. This may highlight the important roles of the FEs mainly inside of the loop subdomain in formation of the burst phase intermediate having a hydrophobic cluster and native-like overall topology and in acquisition of the foldability of DHFR.
The third transmembrane domain (TM3) of serotonin transporter (SERT) contains two isoleucine residues previously proposed to be involved in binding and transport of serotonin. When Ile-172 was replaced with cysteine, SERT became sensitive to inactivation by externally added [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethio-sulfonate (MTSET). The disulfide product of this inactivation was not sensitive to reduction by externally added sulfhydryl compounds, but apparently reacted with intracellular reducing agents to spontaneously regenerate active SERT. The apparent accessibility of this residue to both external and cytoplasmic reagents is consistent with its localization near a serotonin binding site that is alternately exposed to both internal and external media. In another SERT mutant, I179C, transport also was inactivated by MTSET but substrate binding was resistant. External substrate bound to the inactivated I179C and enhanced its reactivation by free thiols. In norepinephrine transporter (NET), cysteine replacement of Ile-155 (corresponding to SERT Ile-179) also rendered the transporter sensitive to MTSET inactivation. In NET I155C, cocaine enhanced this inactivation, and the substrate, dopamine, apparently protected against inactivation. The characteristics of this protection suggest that dopamine was transported, converting NET to a form in which Ile-155 was occluded. The results support the proposal that TM3 of SERT and NET constitute part of the substrate permeation pathway, and that Ile-172 in SERT resides close to the substrate binding site. They also suggest that Ile-179 in SERT (and Ile-155 in NET) is in a conformationally sensitive part of TM3, which may act as part of an external gate."

However, the current control means cannot achieve better efficiency, and it is expected to clarify the molecular mechanism of protein-ligand binding for effective pest control. This study analyzed the expression pattern of CSP2 in S. nitobei (SnitCSP2) and its features of binding to the screened ligands using molecular docking and dynamic simulations. The results showed that SnitCSP2 was significantly expressed in female antennae. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations revealed that SnitCSP2 bound better to the host plant volatile (+)-α-pinene and symbiotic fungal volatiles terpene and (-)-globulol than other target ligands. By the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method, the free binding energies of the three complexes were calculated as -44.813 ± 0.189 kJ/mol, -50.446 ± 0.396 kJ/mol, and -56.418 ± 0.368 kJ/mol, and the van der Waals energy was found to contribute significantly to the stability of the complexes. Some key amino acid residues were also identified: VAL13, GLY14, LYS61, MET65, and LYS68 were important for the stable binding of (+)-α-pinene by SnitCSP2, while for terpenes, ILE16, ALA25, TYR26, CYS29, GLU39, THR37, and GLY40 were vital for a stable binding system. We identified three potential ligands and analyzed the interaction patterns of the proteins with them to provide a favorable molecular basis for regulating insect behavioral interactions and developing new pest control strategies.
The venom of scorpions is a mixture of components that constitute a source of bioactive molecules. The venom of the scorpion Centruroides tecomanus contains peptides toxic to insects, however, to date no toxin responsible for this activity has yet been isolated and fully characterized. This communication describes two new peptides Ct-IT1 and Ct-IT2 purified from this scorpion. Both peptides contain 63 amino acids with molecular weight 6857.85 for Ct-IT1 and 6987.77 Da for Ct-IT2. The soluble venom was separated using chromatographic techniques of molecular size exclusion, cationic exchange, and reverse phase chromatography, allowing the identification of at least 99 components of which in 53 the insecticidal activity was evaluated. The LD50 determined for Ct-IT1 is 3.81 μg/100 mg of cricket weight, but low amounts of peptides (0.8 μg of peptide) already cause paralysis in crickets. The relative abundance of these two peptides in the venom is 2.1% for Ct-IT1 and 1% for Ct-IT2. The molecular masses and N-terminal sequences of both insecticidal toxins were determined by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. The primary structure of both toxins was compared with other known peptides isolated from other scorpion venoms. The analysis of the sequence alignments revealed the position of a highly conserved amino acid residue, Gly39, exclusively present in anti-insect selective depressant β-toxins (DBTXs), which in Ct-IT1 and Ct-IT2 is at position Gly40. Similarly, a three-dimensional structure of this toxins was obtained by homology modeling and compared to the structure of known insect toxins of scorpions. An important similarity of the cavity formed by the trapping apparatus region of the depressant toxin LqhIT2, isolated from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, was found in the toxins described here. These results indicate that Ct-IT1 and Ct-IT2 toxins have a high potential to be evaluated on pests that affect economically important crops to eventually consider them as a potential biological control method.
The anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity with persistent presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Laboratory criteria include aPL detection by coagulation tests for lupus anticoagulant (LAC) or solid phase assays measuring anti-β2 glycoprotein I (aβ2GPI) or anti-cardiolipin (aCL) immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM antibodies. External quality control programs illustrate that commercially available aPL assays produce variable results.
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a major family of small molecule transporter proteins, and their deregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer. Here, we report the crystal structure of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of an amino acid ABC transporter from Thermus thermophilus (TTHA1159) in its apo form and as a complex with ADP along with functional studies. TTHA1159 is a putative arginine ABC transporter. The apo-TTHA1159 was crystallized in dimeric form, a hitherto unreported form of an apo NBD. Structural comparison of the apo and ADP-Mg(2+) complexes revealed that Phe14 of TTHA1159 undergoes a significant conformational change to accommodate ADP, and that the bound ADP interacts with the P-loop (Gly40-Thr45). Modeling of ATP-Mg(2+):TTHA1159 complex revealed that Gln86 and Glu164 are involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonding contacts and Asp163 in Mg(2+) ion-mediated hydrogen bonding contacts with the γ-phosphate of ATP, consistent with the findings of other ABC transporters. Mutational studies confirmed the necessity of each of these residues, and a comparison of the apo/ADP Mg(2+):TTHA1159 with its ATP-complex model suggests the likelihood of a key conformational change to the Gln86 side chain for ATP hydrolysis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24405986/","Glycoside hydrolase family 97 (GH97) comprises enzymes like anomer-inverting α-glucoside hydrolases (i.e., glucoamylase) and anomer-retaining α-galactosidases. In a soil bacterium, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, we previously identified a GH97 enzyme (FjGH97A) within the branched dextran utilization locus. It functions as an α-glucoside hydrolase, targeting α-(1→6)-glucosidic linkages in dextran and isomaltooligosaccharides (i.e., glucodextranase). FjGH97A exhibits a preference for α-(1→6)-glucoside linkages over α-(1→4)-linkages, while Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron glucoamylase SusB (with 69% sequence identity), which is involved in the starch utilization system, exhibits the highest specificity for α-(1→4)-glucosidic linkages. Here, we examined the crystal structures of FjGH97A in complexes with glucose, panose, or isomaltotriose, and analyzed the substrate preferences of its mutants to identify the amino acid residues that determine the substrate specificity for α-(1→4)- and α-(1→6)-glucosidic linkages. The overall structure of FjGH97A resembles other GH97 enzymes, with conserved catalytic residues similar to anomer-inverting GH97 enzymes. A comparison of active sites between FjGH97A and SusB revealed differences in amino acid residues at subsites +1 and +2 (specifically Ala195 and Ile378 in FjGH97A). Among the three mutants (A195S, I378F, and A195S-I378F), A195S and A195S-I378F exhibited increased activity toward α-(1→4)-glucoside bonds compared to α-(1→6)-glucoside bonds. This suggests that Ala195, located on the Gly184-Thr203 loop (named loop-N) conserved within the GH97 subgroup, including FjGH97A and SusB, holds significance in determining linkage specificity. The conservation of alanine in the active site of the GH97 enzymes, within the same gene cluster as the putative dextranase, indicates its crucial role in determining the specificity for α-(1→6)-glucoside linkage.
The insecticide flonicamid (FLO) and its main degradation intermediate 4-trifluoromethylnicotinamide (TFNA-AM) are hazardous to the environment and animals. Microbial transformation of FLO has been well studied, but no study has yet reported on TFNA-AM degradation by a microorganism. Here, Pseudomonas stutzeri CGMCC 22915 effectively degraded TFNA-AM to 5-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid (TFNA). P. stutzeri CGMCC 22915 degraded 60.0% of TFNA-AM (1154.44 μmol/L) within 6 h with a half-life of just 4.5 h. Moreover, P. stutzeri CGMCC 22915 significantly promoted TFNA-AM decomposition in surface water. The reaction was catalyzed by an amidase, PsAmiA. PsAmiA is encoded in a novel nitrile-converting enzyme gene cluster. The enzyme shared only 20-44% identities with previously characterized signature amidases. PsAmiA was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and its enzymatic properties were investigated using TFNA-AM as the substrate. PsAmiA was more active toward amides without hydrophilic groups, and did not hydrolyze another amide metabolite of FLO, N-(4-trifluoromethylnicotinoyl)glycinamide (TFNG-AM), which is structurally very similar to TFNA-AM. Molecular docking of PsAmiA and TFNA-AM indicated that hydrophobic residues Leu148, Ala150, Ala195, Ile225, Trp341, Leu460, and Ile463 may affect its substrate spectrum. This study provides new insights of the environmental fate of FLO at the molecular level and the structure-function relationships of amidases.
Oxytropis falcata Bunge is a legume distributed in Northwest China, which is mainly used to treat knife wounds and inflammation.

However, the healing mechanism of quercetin in cutaneous wound remains elusive.
The dual inhibition of adenosine receptors A1 (A1 AR) and A2 (A2A AR) has been considered as an efficient strategy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). This led to the recent development of a series of methoxy-substituted benzofuran derivatives among which compound 3j exhibited dual-inhibitory potencies in the micromolar range. Therefore, in this study, we seek to resolve the mechanisms by which this novel compound elicits its selective dual targeting against A1 AR and A2A AR. Unique to the binding of 3j in both proteins, from our findings, is the ring-ring interaction elicited by A1Phe275 (→ A2Phe170) with the benzofuran ring of the compound. As observed, this π-stacking interaction contributes notably to the stability of 3j at the active sites of A1 and A2A AR. Besides, conserved active site residues in the proteins such as A1Ala170 (→ A2Ala65), A1Ile173 (→ A2Ile68), A1Val191 (→ A2Val86), A1Leu192 (→ A2Leu87), A1Ala195 (→ A2Ala90), A1Met284 (→ A2Met179), A1Tyr375 (→ A2Tyr369), A1Ile378 (→ A2Ile372), and A1His382 (→ A2His376) were commonly involved with other ring substituents which further complement the dual binding and stability of 3j. This reflects a similar interaction mechanism that involved aromatic (π) interactions. Consequentially, vdW energies contributed immensely to the dual binding of the compound, which culminated in high ΔGbinds that were homogenous in both proteins. Furthermore, 3j commonly disrupted the stable and compact conformation of A1 and A2A AR, coupled with their active sites where Cα deviations were relatively high. Ligand mobility analysis also revealed that both compounds exhibited a similar motion pattern at the active site of the proteins relative to their optimal dual binding. We believe that findings from this study with significantly aid the structure-based design of highly selective dual-inhibitors of A1 and A2A AR.
Since 2009, erysipelas infection among pigs in Japan has been increasing. This study investigated the prevalence, and characteristics of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae isolates in Japan from 2008 to 2010 and assessed the efficacy of current commercial erysipelas vaccines. Based on polymorphisms in a 432-bp hypervariable region in the surface protective antigen A (spaA) gene, 34 isolates were classified into three groups: (i) Group 1 with methionine at position 203 (Met-203) and isoleucine at position 257 (Ile-257) (18 isolates of serotype 1a and one untypable isolate). (ii) Group 2 with Ile-257 (12 isolates of serotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 10 and 11), and (iii) Group 3 with alanine at position 195 (Ala-195) and Ile-257 (three isolates of serotype 1a). Isolates with Met-203 were highly pathogenic in mice and pigs, causing death in the pig and LD50 values of 0.45-1.45 CFU per mouse. One live and three inactivated commercial E. rhusiopathiae vaccines were evaluated for efficacy against a Met-203 isolate. Almost all mice and pigs that received vaccine survived, while non-vaccinated controls all died within 5 days of the challenge. This indicates that swine erysipelas vaccines might be still effective in protecting animals against the recently prevalent Met-203 isolates in Japan."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11135497/","In the genetic model Aspergillus nidulans, hyphal growth is exquisitely dependent on exocytic traffic. Following mutagenic PCR and gene replacement, we characterized thermosensitive mutations in sarA(SAR1) encoding a key regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit. Six sarA(ts) alleles permitting relatively normal growth at 30°C prevented it at 42°C. This growth phenotype correlated with markedly reduced SarA levels at high temperature, suggesting that these alleles cause temperature-dependent SarA misfolding. sarA8 results in Ser substitution for conserved P-loop Gly27. sarA5 (Trp185Cys) and sarA6 (Ser186Pro) substitutions underscore the importance of the C-terminal α-helix on SarA(Sar1) function/stability. sarA6 markedly diminishing growth at 37°C was useful for microscopy experiments in which ER exit was impaired by shifting the incubation temperature. Early and late Golgi cisternae, labeled with the integral membrane syntaxins SedV(Sed5) and TlgB(Tlg2) , respectively, were rapidly dissipated by sarA6. However, whereas SedV(Sed5) was shifted toward the ER, TlgB(Tlg2) relocalized to a haze, underscoring the asymmetry of Golgi organization. This rapid Golgi dissipation that takes place after blocking anterograde COPII traffic is consistent with the cisternal maturation model. Incubation of sarA6 cells at 37°C led to the formation of apical balloons resembling specialized fungal structures. The formation of these balloons highlights the morphogenetic consequences of impairing ER exit.
A Spanish family affected with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) with a diffuse phenotype showed a mutation in the rhodopsin gene. The mutation was the transition T-->C in codon 186, which has been reported once before in an American patient (Dryja et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1991;88:9370-9374). This change replaces a serine by a proline in the second intradiscal loop of the protein, generating a molecule that is probably folding- and transport-defective."

Prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) are crucial for intracellular oxygen sensing and organism survival. However, it remains to be clarified whether or how PHDs are involved in the regulation of β(2) -adrenoceptor (β(2) -AR) signalling. Here we show that PHD2 can modulate the rate of β(2) -AR internalization through interactions with β-arrestin 2. PHD2 hydroxylates β-arrestin 2 at the proline (Pro)(176), Pro(179) and Pro(181) sites, which retards the recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane and inhibits subsequent co-internalization with β(2) -AR into the cytosol. β(2) -AR internalization is critical to control the temporal and spatial aspects of β(2) -AR signalling. Identifying novel regulators of β(2) -AR internalization will enable us to develop new strategies to manipulate receptor signalling and provide potential targets for drug development in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with β(2) -AR signalling dysregulation.
Reversible protein glutathionylation plays a key role in cellular regulation and cell signaling and protects protein thiols from hyperoxidation. Sulfiredoxin (Srx), an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of Cys-sulfinic acid derivatives of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-Cys Prxs), has been shown to catalyze the deglutathionylation of actin. We show that deglutathionylation of 2-Cys Prx, a family of peroxidases, is specifically catalyzed by Srx. Using the ubiquitously expressed member of 2-Cys Prx, Prx I, we revealed the following. (i) Among its four Cys residues, Cys(52), Cys(83), and Cys(173) can be glutathionylated in vitro. Deglutathionylation with Cys mutants showed that Cys(83) and Cys(173) were preferentially catalyzed by Srx, with glutathionylated Srx as the reaction intermediate, whereas glutaredoxin I was more favorable for deglutathionylating Cys(52). (ii) Studies using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with binding and deglutathionylation activities revealed that Pro(174) and Pro(179) of Prx I and Tyr(92) of Srx are essential for both activities. Furthermore, relative to glutaredoxin I, Srx exhibited negligible deglutathionylation activity for glutathionylated cysteine and glutathionylated BSA. These results indicate that Srx is specific for deglutathionylating Prx I due to its favorable affinity for Prx I. To assess the biological relevance of these observations, we showed that Prx I is glutathionylated in A549 and HeLa cells under modest levels of H(2)O(2). In addition, the level of glutathionylated Prx I was substantially elevated in small interfering RNA-mediated Srx-knocked down cells, whereas the reverse was observed in Srx-overexpressing cells. However, glutathionylation of Prx V, not known to bind to Srx, was not affected by the change in Srx expression levels.
PTK6 (also known as Brk) is an intracellular tyrosine kinase that contains SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase catalytic (Kinase) domains. The SH3 domain of PTK6 interacts with the N-terminal half of the linker (Linker) region between the SH2 and Kinase domains. Site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance studies showed that a tryptophan residue (Trp44) in the SH3 domain and proline residues in the Linker region, in the order of Pro177, Pro175, and Pro179, contribute to the interaction. The three-dimensional modeled structure of the SH3-Linker complex was in agreement with the biochemical data. Disruption of the intramolecular interaction between the SH3 domain and the Linker region by mutation of Trp44, Pro175, Pro177, and Pro179 markedly increased the catalytic activity of PTK6 in HEK 293 cells. These results demonstrate that Trp44 in the SH3 domain and Pro177, Pro175, and Pro179 in the N-terminal half of the Linker region play important roles in the SH3-Linker interaction to maintain the protein in an inactive conformation along with the phosphorylated Tyr447-SH2 interaction.
Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is an essential constituent of pulmonary surfactant. SP-B is synthesized in alveolar type II cells as a preproprotein and processed to the mature peptide by the cleavage of NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides. An aspartyl protease has been suggested to cleave the NH2-terminal propeptide resulting in a 25-kDa intermediate. Napsin, an aspartyl protease expressed in alveolar type II cells, was detected in fetal lung homogenates as early as day 16 of gestation, 1 day before the onset of SP-B expression and processing. Napsin was localized to multivesicular bodies, the site of SP-B proprotein processing in type II cells. Incubation of SP-B proprotein from type II cells with a crude membrane extract from napsin-transfected cells resulted in enhanced levels of a 25-kDa intermediate. Purified napsin cleaved a recombinant SP-B/EGFP fusion protein within the NH2-terminal propeptide between Leu178 and Pro179, 22 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Cathepsin H, a cysteine protease also implicated in pro-SP-B processing, cleaved SP-B/EGFP fusion protein 13 amino acids upstream of the NH2 terminus of mature SP-B. Napsin did not cleave the COOH-terminal peptide, whereas cathepsin H cleaved the boundary between mature SP-B and the COOH-terminal peptide and at several other sites within the COOH-terminal peptide. Knockdown of napsin by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased levels of mature SP-B and mature SP-C in type II cells. These results suggest that napsin, cathepsin H, and at least one other enzyme are involved in maturation of the biologically active SP-B peptide."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20837755/","Neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, hypotonia and variable brain anomalies (NMIHBA) is an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder characterized by global developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. Microcephaly, progressive cortical atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia and delayed myelination are neurological hallmarks in affected individuals. NMIHBA is caused by biallelic variants in PRUNE1 encoding prune exopolyphosphatase 1. We provide in-depth clinical description of two affected siblings harboring compound heterozygous variant alleles, c.383G > A (p.Arg128Gln), c.520G > T (p.Gly174*) in PRUNE1. To gain insights into disease biology, we biochemically characterized missense variants within the conserved N-terminal aspartic acid-histidine-histidine (DHH) motif and provide evidence that they result in the destabilization of protein structure and/or loss of exopolyphosphatase activity. Genetic ablation of Prune1 results in midgestational lethality in mice, associated with perturbations to embryonic growth and vascular development. Our findings suggest that NMIHBA results from hypomorphic variant alleles in humans and underscore the potential key role of PRUNE1 exopolyphoshatase activity in neurodevelopment.
Pyrophosphate synthetase-1(PRS-1) is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) with substrate: adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ribose-5-phophate(R5P) in the de novo pathways of purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. Mutation in PRPS1 can result in a series of diseases of purine metabolism, which includes PRS-1 superactivity. The common clinical phenotypes are hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. We identified a novel missense mutation in X-chromosomal gene PRPS1 in a young Chinese woman while her mother has heterogeneous genotype and phenotype. A 24-year-old Chinese female patient suffered hyperuricemia, gout, and recurrent hyperpyrexia for more than 6 years, and then was diagnosed with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance (IR), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A novel missense mutation, c.521(exon)G>T, p.(Gly174Val) was detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and her parents. Interestingly, her mother has the same heterozygous missense mutation but without uric acid overproduction which can be explained by the phenomenon of the skewed X-chromosome inactivation. The substituted amino acid Val for Gly174 is positioned in the pyrophosphate (PPi) binding loop, and this mutation impacts the binding rate of Mg2+-ATP complex to PRS-1, thus the assembling of homodimer is affected by changed Val174 leading to the instability of the allosteric site. Our report highlights the X-linked inheritance of gout in females caused by mutation in PRPS1 accompanied with severe metabolic disorders and recurrent hyperpyrexia.
NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) is a homodimeric protein that acts as a detoxifying enzyme or as a chaperone protein. Dicourmarol interacts with NQO1 at the NAD(P)H binding site and can both inhibit enzyme activity and modulate the interaction of NQO1 with other proteins. We show that the binding of dicoumarol and related compounds to NQO1 generates negative cooperativity between the monomers. This does not occur in the presence of the reducing cofactor, NAD(P)H, alone. Alteration of Gly150 (but not Gly149 or Gly174) abolished the dicoumarol-induced negative cooperativity. Analysis of the dynamics of NQO1 with the Gaussian network model indicates a high degree of collective motion by monomers and domains within NQO1. Ligand binding is predicted to alter NQO1 dynamics both proximal to the ligand binding site and remotely, close to the second binding site. Thus, drug-induced modulation of protein motion might contribute to the biological effects of putative inhibitors of NQO1.
This study aimed to evaluate genetic variability in the FUS and TDP-43 genes, known to be mainly associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in patients with the diagnoses of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). We screened the DNA of 228 patients for all the exons and flanking introns of FUS and TDP-43 genes. We identified 2 novel heterozygous missense mutations in FUS: P106L (g.22508384C>T) in a patient with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Q179H in several members of a family with behavioral variant FTD. We also identified the N267S mutation in TDP-43 in a CBS patient, previously only reported in 1 ALS family and 1 FTD patient. Additionally, we identified 2 previously reported heterozygous insertion and deletion mutations in Exon 5 of FUS; Gly174-Gly175 del GG (g. 4180-4185 delGAGGTG) in an FTD patient and Gly175-Gly176 ins GG (g. 4185-4186 insGAGGTG) in a patient with diagnosis of CBS. Not least, we have found a series of variants in FUS also in neurologically normal controls. In summary, we report that genetic variability in FUS and TDP-43 encompasses a wide range of phenotypes (including ALS, FTD, and CBS) and that there is substantial genetic variability in FUS gene in neurologically normal controls.
Resistance to linezolid (LZD) occurs through mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 or through methylation of 23S rRNA by Cfr. Here we report novel L3 mutations, ΔSer145/His146Tyr and ΔMet169-Gly174, co-occurring with cfr in LZD-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from a hospital outbreak in Madrid, Spain. LZD MIC values (16, 32, or 64 μg/ml) correlated with the presence and severity of the L3 mutation. All isolates had TR-700 (torezolid) MIC values of ≤ 2 μg/ml."

In this paper, we report the prediction of new ciprofloxacin derivatives by quantum chemical, molecular docking studies and pharmacokinetic properties. Theoretical studies were performed by geometry optimization computation using B3LYP level at 6-311 G (d,p) basis set. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) parameters were predicted and the result show that all compounds have a great ADMET profile. To study the antibacterial, anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activities, ciprofloxacin and its derivatives were interacted with the proteins: Thymidylate Kinase (PDB: 4QGG), Biotin carboxylase (PDB: 3JZF) and β-lactamase BlaC (PDB: 3N7W). The results of the docking studies indicate that one pharmacophore designed presents a great inhibition behavior against gram-positive organism (4QGG) and significant interactions observed between the compound and ARG48, GLN101, ARG105 and GLU37 residues of 4QGG. Also, another derivative designed present the best inhibition against gram-negative organism (3JZF) several interactions were noticed between the compound and GLY165, ILE287, LEU278, HIS236, HIS209, MET169 and LYS159 residues of (3JZF). As well as, one designed candidate is good inhibitors for β-lactamase (3N7W) multiple no bonded interactions were observed between the compound and SER84, ILE117, ASN186, LYS87, ARG187, ASN186 and THR251 residues of(3N7W). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was also performed for 100 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the main protein and inhibitor complexes. The MD simulation study validated the stability of three compounds in the protein binding pocket as potent binders. Natural bonding orbital analysis, reactivity indices and molecular electrostatic potential were carried out. The research finding of this study can be helpful to design a new potent antibacterial, antimycrobacterium candidate's drugs that will serve as the basis for future in vitro and in vivo research.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (GSAM) catalyzes the isomerization of glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) to 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and is distributed in archaea, most bacteria and plants. Although structures of GSAM from archaea and bacteria have been resolved, a GSAM structure from a higher plant is not available, preventing further structure-function analysis. Here, the structure of GSAM from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGSA1) obtained by X-ray crystallography is reported at 1.25 Å resolution. AtGSA1 forms an asymmetric dimer and displays asymmetry in cofactor binding as well as in the gating-loop orientation, which is consistent with previously reported Synechococcus GSAM structures. While one monomer binds PMP with the gating loop fixed in the open state, the other monomer binds either PMP or PLP and the gating loop is ready to close. The data also reveal the mobility of residues Gly163, Ser164 and Gly165, which are important for reorientation of the gating loop. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the AtGSA1 structure supports the previously proposed negative cooperativity between monomers of GSAM.
In many gram-negative bacteria, the type III secretion system (T3SS), as a virulence factor, is an attractive target for developing novel antibacterial. Regarding this, in our study, we aimed to identify the putative drug target for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, considering ATPase enzyme involved in the type III secretion system. Selective protein sequence of P. aeruginosa involved in the T3SS was retrieved from NCBI databases, and its homologues were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Its association in T3SS was analyzed via STRING, and the 3D structure was determined by means of homology modeling followed by intensive optimization and validation. The binding site was predicted by 3DLigandSite and examined through molecular docking simulation by Autodock Vina with salicylidene acylhydrazide class of virulence-blocking compounds. PROCHECK analysis showed that 96.7 % of the residues were in the most favored regions, 1.9 % were in the additional allowed region, and 1.4 % were in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The refined model yielded ERRAT scores of 88.124 and Verify3D value of 0.2, which indicates that the environmental profile of the model is good. The best binding affinity was observed by ME0055 compound, and ALA160, ALA161, GlY162, GLY163, GLY164, GLY165, SER166, THR167, TYR338, and PRO339 residues were found to be having complementary in the ligand-binding site. However, these findings should be further confirmed by wet lab studies for design a targeted therapeutic agent.
Enzyme promiscuity describes the ability of biocatalysts to catalyze conversions beyond their natural reactions. Enzyme engineering to promote side reactions is attractive for synthetic and industrial applications. For instance, a subtilisin Carlsberg protease variant (T58A/L216W) catalyzes in addition to its proteolytic activity the generation of peroxycarboxylic acids from corresponding esters in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In the current study we used a semi-rational design approach to shift the specificity of subtilisin Carlsberg towards production of peroxycarboxylic acid. Among other identified amino acid substitutions, position Gly165 in the S1 binding pocket provided insights in subtilisin Carlsberg's promiscuity by promoting ester perhydrolysis. Catalytic constants of subtilisin Carlsberg for perhydrolysis of methyl-propionate, methyl-butyrate and methyl-pentanoate were increased up to 3.5-, 5.4- and 5.5-fold, respectively, while proteolysis was decreased up to 100-fold for N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide substrate (suc-AAPF-pNA).
Extensive research has provided ample evidences suggesting that protein folding in the cell is a co-translational process. However, the exact pathway that polypeptide chain follows during co-translational folding to achieve its functional form is still an enigma. In order to understand this process and to determine the exact conformation of the co-translational folding intermediates, it is essential to develop techniques that allow the isolation of RNCs carrying nascent chains of predetermined sizes to allow their further structural analysis. SecM (secretion monitor) is a 170 amino acid E. coli protein that regulates expression of the downstream SecA (secretion driving) ATPase in the secM-secA operon. Nakatogawa and Ito originally found that a 17 amino acid long sequence (150-FSTPVWISQAQGIRAGP-166) in the C-terminal region of the SecM protein is sufficient and necessary to cause stalling of SecM elongation at Gly165, thereby producing peptidyl-glycyl-tRNA stably bound to the ribosomal P-site. More importantly, it was found that this 17 amino acid long sequence can be fused to the C-terminus of virtually any full-length and/or truncated protein thus allowing the production of RNCs carrying nascent chains of predetermined sizes. Thus, when fused or inserted into the target protein, SecM stalling sequence produces arrest of the polypeptide chain elongation and generates stable RNCs both in vivo in E. coli cells and in vitro in a cell-free system. Sucrose gradient centrifugation is further utilized to isolate RNCs. The isolated RNCs can be used to analyze structural and functional features of the co-translational folding intermediates. Recently, this technique has been successfully used to gain insights into the structure of several ribosome bound nascent chains. Here we describe the isolation of bovine Gamma-B Crystallin RNCs fused to SecM and generated in an in vitro translation system."

It includes over 20 defined subtypes, each of which is associated with distinct causative genes that are listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Type XXII OI (OI 22) is caused by a homozygous variant in the coiled-coil domain containing 134 (CCDC134) gene, which is located on chromosome 22q13. OI, which is associated with CCDC134, is extremely rare with only five cases reported worldwide. All known cases involve the c.2 T > C (p. Met1Thr) homozygous missense variant in the CCDC134 gene. We present the case of a 13-year-old Chinese girl with non-union fracture, short stature and specific radiographic findings, which include scoliosis, pelvic tilt, thin clavicles, ribs, and limbs. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel, homozygous c.492G > C (p. Leu164=) variation in the CCDC134 gene. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified this variant as an abnormal splicing variant that causes the deletion of Exon 5, which result in the observed disease phenotype. This case demonstrates the clinical phenotype of OI 22 associated with the c.492G > C (p. Leu164=) novel synonymous variation in the coding region of the CCDC134 gene in a female patient. This is the first reported case of OI 22 in the Chinese population, the sixth reported worldwide and the fourth reported genotype for diseases associated with a CCDC134 variant. It also enriches the global clinical phenotype spectrum of OI 22 patients.
Malaria is a significant global public health issue, particularly prevalent in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, necessitating urgent research into novel and efficient therapies. In the current research, we have designed pyridine substituted pyrazole 1,3,5-triazine derivatives as antimalarials. A library including 300 compounds, designated as 7S (1-300), has been generated using a variety of aliphatic and aromatic amines. Ten compounds have been selected via in silico screening such as molecular properties, toxicity study, docking study and conventional synthesis for antimalarial evaluation against P. falciparum strains 3D7 (chloroquine-sensitive) and Dd2 (chloroquine-resistant). The docking results of compounds 7s258 and 7s5 revealed higher binding interaction with amino acids Leu46, Phe58, Phe116, Ala16 (-341.33 kcal/mol), Ser111, Ile112, Val45 Pro113, Leu119 (-335.16 kcal/mol) and Phe58, Ser111, Ile112, Phe116 (-354.47 kcal/mol), Phe58, Met55, Leu46, Leu164, Pro113 (-346.34 kcal/mol) against wild (1J3I) and quadruple mutant (1J3K) type of Pf-DHFR inhibitors. Further these compounds were synthesized by simple nucleophilic substitution reaction and characterized by different spectroscopic methods. The in vitro antimalarial assay results suggested that these compounds exhibit considerable antimalarial activity with IC50 values of 32.74-46.80 μM and 28.05-54.95 μM against both the chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) strains of P. falciparum, respectively. Among the ten derivatives, compound 7s258 and 7s5 show substantial potential as antimalarial agents. They are highly suitable for further refinement in the field of drug development to effectively decrease the global malarial burden.
Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a metabolic regulator that catalyzes the methylation of nicotinamide (Nam) using the co-factor S-adenosyl-L-methionine to form 1-methyl-nicotinamide (MNA). Overexpression of NNMT and the presence of the active metabolite MNA is associated with a number of diseases including metabolic disorders. We conducted a high-throughput screening campaign that led to the identification of a tricyclic core as a potential NNMT small molecule inhibitor series. Elaborate medicinal chemistry efforts were undertaken and hundreds of analogs were synthesized to understand the structure activity relationship and structure property relationship of this tricyclic series. A lead molecule, JBSNF-000028, was identified that inhibits human and mouse NNMT activity, reduces MNA levels in mouse plasma, liver and adipose tissue, and drives insulin sensitization, glucose modulation and body weight reduction in a diet-induced obese mouse model of diabetes. The co-crystal structure showed that JBSNF-000028 binds below a hairpin structural motif at the nicotinamide pocket and stacks between Tyr-204 (from Hairpin) and Leu-164 (from central domain). JBSNF-000028 was inactive against a broad panel of targets related to metabolism and safety. Interestingly, the improvement in glucose tolerance upon treatment with JBSNF-000028 was also observed in NNMT knockout mice with diet-induced obesity, pointing towards the glucose-normalizing effect that may go beyond NNMT inhibition. JBSNF-000028 can be a potential therapeutic option for metabolic disorders and developmental studies are warranted.
Nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyl transferase (Rv2421c) was selected as a potential drug target, because it has been shown, in vitro, to be essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. It is conserved between mycobacterium species, is up-regulated during dormancy, has a known 3D crystal structure and has no known human homologs. A model of Rv2421c in complex with nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and magnesium ion was constructed and subject tovirtual ligand screening against the Prestwick Chemical Library and the ZINC database, which yielded 155 potential hit molecules. Of the 155 compounds identified five were pursued further using an IC50 based 3D-QSAR study. The 3D-QSAR model validated the inhibition properties of the five compounds based on R2 value of 0.895 and Q2 value of 0.944 compared to known inhibitors of Rv2421c. Higher binding affinities was observed for the novel ZINC13544129 and two FDA approved compounds (Novobiocin sodium salt, Sulfasalazine). Similarly, the total interaction energy was found to be the highest for Cromolyn disodium system (-418.88 kJ/mol) followed by Novobiocin (-379.19 kJ/mol) and Sulfasalazine with (-330.13 kJ/mol) compared to substrate DND having (-185.52 kJ/mol). Subsequent in vitro testing of the five compounds identified Novobiocin sodium salt with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 50 μM, 25μM and weakly at 10μM concentrations. Novobiocin salt interacts with a MG ion and active site residues His20, Thr86, Gly107 and Leu164 similar to substrate DND of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2421c. Additional in silico structural analysis of known Novobiocin sodium salt derivatives against Rv2421c suggest Coumermycin as a promising alternative for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on large number of hydrogen bond interactions with Rv2421c similar in comparison to Novobiocin salt and substrate DND.
In a bid to come up with effective compounds as inhibitors for antimalarial treatment, we built a library of 2,000 traditional Chinese medicine(TCM)-derived compounds retrieved from TCM Database@Taiwan."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9502574/","Bernard-Soulier syndrome is a very rare form of inherited thrombocytopenia that derives from mutations in GPIbα, GPIbβ, or GPIX and is typically inherited as a recessive disease. However, some years ago it was shown that the monoallelic c.515C>T transition in the GPIBA gene (Bolzano mutation) was responsible for macrothrombocytopenia in a few Italian patients.
Although mutations of GPIb alpha are among the most frequent causes of inherited platelet disorders, the mechanisms for the onset of thrombocytopenia and platelet macrocytosis are still poorly defined.
A form of autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia is characterized by mild or no clinical symptoms, normal platelet function, and normal megakaryocyte count. Because this condition has so far received little attention, patients are subject to misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy. To identify the molecular basis of this disease, 12 Italian families were studied by linkage analysis and mutation screening. Flow cytometry evaluations of platelet membrane glycoproteins (GPs) were also performed. Linkage analysis in 2 large families localized the gene to chromosome 17p, in an interval containing an excellent candidate, the GPIbalpha gene. GPIbalpha, together with other proteins, constitutes the plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) receptor, which is altered in Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). In 6 of 12 families, a heterozygous Ala156Val missense substitution was identified. Platelet membrane GP studies were performed in 10 patients. Eight were distinguished by a reduction of GPs comparable to that found in a BSS heterozygous condition, whereas the other 2, without the Ala156Val mutation, had a normal content of platelet GPs. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that most (10 of 12) patients with an original diagnosis of autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia shared clinical and molecular features with the heterozygous BSS phenotype. The remaining 2 affected subjects represented patients with ""true"" autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia; the GPIb/IX/V complex was normally distributed on the surface of their platelets. Thus, the diagnosis of heterozygous BSS must always be suspected in patients with inherited thrombocytopenia and platelet macrocytosis.
Bartter syndrome, an autosomal recessive renal tubular disorder, is associated with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with high renin and aldosterone plasma concentrations with low or normal blood pressure and renal salt loss. Two genes, the gene encoding the furosemide-sensitive apical Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) and the gene encoding the luminal inwardly-rectifying potassium channel Kir 1.1 (ROMK), have been reported to cause the neonatal subtype of Bartter syndrome. In a patient with neonatal Bartter syndrome, we report two novel mutations resulting in amino acid exchanges Ala156Val and Leu220Phe in the gene for Kir 1.1 that have been identified by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and subsequent direct sequencing. Both mutations occur in functional relevant domains of the channel protein and are therefore highly suggestive of altering channel properties."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32274531/","Thrombin is a crucial enzyme in the coagulation cascade, and inhibitors of thrombin have been extensively studied as potential antithrombotic agents. The objective of this study was to identify natural inhibitors of thrombin from Panax notoginseng and evaluate their biological activity in vitro and binding characteristics. A combined approach involving molecular docking, thrombin inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular dynamics simulation was utilized to identify natural thrombin inhibitors. The results demonstrated that panaxatriol directly inhibits thrombin, with an IC50 of 10.3 µM. Binding studies using surface plasmon resonance revealed that panaxatriol interacts with thrombin, with a KD value of 7.8 µM. Molecular dynamics analysis indicated that the thrombin-panaxatriol system reached equilibrium rapidly with minimal fluctuations, and the calculated binding free energy was - 23.8 kcal/mol. The interaction between panaxatriol and thrombin involves the amino acid residues Glu146, Glu192, Gly216, Gly219, Tyr60A, and Trp60D. This interaction provides a mechanistic basis for further optimizing panaxatriol as a thrombin inhibitor. Our study has shown that panaxatriol serves as a direct thrombin inhibitor, laying the groundwork for further research and development of novel thrombin inhibitors.
A thrombin-activity-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was successfully constructed using tungsten oxide quantum dots (WO3-x QDS) as the co-reactant and thrombin-cleavable peptides as the recognizer. Specifically, Ru(bpy)32+ were doped on silica nanoparticles (Ru@SiO2), which greatly enhanced the ECL potential. AuNPs@WO3-x QDs composite was then prepared to accelerate electron transfer and improve the ECL signal by 219 times. Under ideal conditions, the limit of detection for thrombin in serum was determined to be 0.28 μU/mL with a linear range from 1 μU/mL to 1 U/mL. In addition, the developed ECL biosensor was used to screen for thrombin inhibitors from 12 compounds in Artemisiae Argyi Folium. Among the compounds tested, it was observed that 100 μmol/L luteolin exhibited a significantly higher inhibition rate (exceeding 80%) compared to apigenin, isorhamnetin, naringin, or eriodictyol. In an in-vitro anticoagulation experiment, luteolin (100 μmol/L) prolonged APTT by 49%, and the molecular docking assay indicated that luteolin had binding sites of Gly219 and Asp189 in the active pockets of thrombin. This may have been the main reason underpinning luteolin's anticoagulation effects. Overall, the Ru@WO3-x QDS ECL biosensor provided a reliable strategy for thrombin activity assay and screening of anticoagulant agents.
Thrombin, a crucial enzyme involved in blood coagulation and associated diseases, requires accurate detection of its activity and screening of inhibitors for clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. To address this, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method was developed to detect thrombin activity based on the sensitization of Ti3C2Tx MXene, which could sensitize the Ru(bpy)32+ ECL system greatly. The thrombin-cleavable substrate bio-S-G-R-P-V-L-G-C was used as recognizer to evaluate the activity of thrombin. Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection for thrombin in serum was 83 pU/mL (S/N = 3) with a linear range from 0.1 nU/mL to 1 µU/mL. Moreover, the developed ECL biosensor was employed to screen for thrombin inhibitors from Artemisiae argyi Folium. Four potential thrombin inhibitors (isoquercitrin, nepetin, L-camphor, L-borneol) were screened out with inhibition rates beyond 50%, among which isoquercitrin had the best inhibition rate of 90.26%. Isoquercitrin and nepetin were found to be competitive inhibitors of thrombin, with [Formula: see text] values of 0.91 μM and 2.18 μM, respectively. Molecular docking results showed that these compounds could interact with the active sites of thrombin through hydrogen bonds including ASP189, SER195, GLY216, and GLY219. The electrochemical biosensor constructed provides a new idea for the detection of thrombin activity and screening of its inhibitors.
In this study; a spectrum-effect relationship analysis combined with a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was established to screen and identify active components that can inhibit thrombin and factor Xa (THR and FXa) in Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Danshen-Chuanxiong) herbal pair. Ten potential active compounds were predicted through a canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and eight of them were tentatively identified through an LC-MS analysis. Furthermore; the enzyme inhibitory activity of six available compounds; chlorogenic acid; Z-ligustilide; caffeic acid; ferulic acid; tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA; were tested to verify the feasibility of the method. Among them; chlorogenic acid was validated to possess a good THR inhibitory activity with IC50 of 185.08 µM. Tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA are potential FXa inhibitors with IC50 of 112.59 µM and 138.19 µM; respectively. Meanwhile; molecular docking results show that tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA; which both have binding energies of less than -7.0 kcal·mol-1; can interact with FXa by forming H-bonds with residues of SER214; GLY219 and GLN192. In short; the THR and FXa inhibitors in the Danshen-Chuanxiong herbal pair have been successfully characterized through a spectrum-effect relationship analysis and an LC-MS analysis.
ISP-SW5 is an intracellular alkaline serine protease gene from Bacillus velezensis SW5 that was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Sequence analysis indicated that the ISP-SW5 gene has 960 bp open reading frame and encodes a protein of 319 amino acid residues. Three-dimensional structure of ISP-SW5 with the fibrinolytic activity from Bacillus velezensis was predicted by in silico analysis. Gly219 was the most likely active site for the fibrinolytic activity of ISP-SW5. The recombinant enzyme ISP-SW5 was purified by Ni-NTA Superflow Column. SDS-PAGE showed that this enzyme had a molecular mass of 34 kDa. The result of native-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing showed that the N-terminal propeptide of ISP-SW5 was cleaved during the maturation of protease. The optimum pH and temperature were 8.0 and 40 °C, respectively. Enzyme activity was markedly inhibited by PMSF and EDTA but enhanced by 5 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Zn2+ by up to 143% and 115%, respectively. Additionally, ISP-SW5 retained 93%, 78%, and 49% relative enzyme activity after incubation with 0.5 M, 1 M and 2 M NaCl, respectively, at 4 °C for 12 h. The enzyme activity determined by casein as substrate was 1261 U/mg. ISP-SW5 could degrade fibrin at an activity of 3428 U/mg, and its properties reflect its potential application in developing a novel biological catalyst for efficient fibrin hydrolysis in medical treatment."

The LODs for KIT in different animal tissues ranged from 22.47 μg/kg to 29.32 μg/kg, and the recoveries of the fortified tissues were 70% ~ 120% with coefficients of variation below 20%. Then, KIT-specific scFv KA/2A9/3 was prepared for the first time. Homologous modeling and molecular docking results indicated that the key amino acids of KA/2A9/3 scFv are TYR-92 (CDRL3), SER-93 (CDRL3), ASP-155 (CDRH1) and GLY-226 (CDRH3), and the hydrogen bond is the main force. And then, virtual mutation provides a method to evolve KA/2A9/3 scFv antibodies. These results contribute to comprehending the antigen-antibody binding mechanism and provide effective information for in vitro affinity maturation of anti-KIT scFv.
Human granzyme H (GzmH) is constitutively expressed in human NK cells that have important roles in innate immune responses against tumors and viruses. GzmH is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease. Its substrate preference and its mechanism of substrate recognition are poorly understood. To provide structural insights into the substrate recognition mechanisms for GzmH, we solved the crystal structures of a D102N-GzmH mutant alone and in complex with a decapeptide substrate and an inhibitor to 2.2 Å, 2.4 Å, and 2.7 Å, respectively. The Thr(189), Gly(216), and Gly(226) specificity triad in the S1 pocket of GzmH defines its preference for bulky, aromatic residues (Tyr and Phe) at the P1 position. Notably, we discovered that an unusual RKR motif (Arg(39)-Lys(40)-Arg(41)), conserved only in GzmH, helps define the S3' and S4' binding regions, indicating the preference for acidic residues at the P3' and P4' sites. Disruption of the RKR motif or the acidic P3' and P4' residues in the substrate abolished the proteolytic activity of GzmH. We designed a tetrapeptide chloromethylketone inhibitor, Ac-PTSY-chloromethylketone, which can selectively and efficiently block the enzymatic and cytotoxic activity of GzmH, providing a useful tool for further studies on the function of GzmH.
Crustacean serine proteases (Brachyurins, EC 3.4.21.32) exhibit a wide variety of primary specificities and no member of this family has been reported for spiny lobsters. The aim of this work was to study the diversity of trypsins in the digestive gland of Panulirus argus. Several trypsin-like proteases were cloned and the results suggest that at least three gene families encode trypsins in the lobster. Three-dimensional comparative models of each trypsin anticipated differences in the interaction of these enzymes with proteinaceous substrates and inhibitors. Most of the studied enzymes were typical trypsins, but one could not be allocated to any of the brachyurins groups due to amino acid substitutions found in the vicinity of the active site. Among other changes in this form of the enzyme, conserved Gly216 and Gly226 (chymotrypsin numbering) are substituted by Leu and Pro, respectively, while retaining all other key residues for trypsin specificity. These substitutions may impair the access of bulky residues to the S1 site while they make the pocket more hydrophobic. The physiological role of this form of the enzyme could be relevant as it was found to be highly expressed in lobster. Further studies on the specificity and structure of this variant must be performed to locate it within the brachyurins family. It is suggested that specificity within this family of enzymes is broader than is currently believed.
3(17)alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) is a unique member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily owing to its ability to reduce 17-ketosteroids to 17alpha-hydroxysteroids, as opposed to other members of the AKR family, which can only produce 17beta-hydroxysteroids. In this paper, the crystal structure of a double mutant (G225P/G226P) of AKR1C21 in complex with the coenzyme NADP(+) and the inhibitor hexoestrol refined at 2.1 A resolution is presented. Kinetic analysis and molecular-modelling studies of 17alpha- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid substrates in the active site of AKR1C21 suggested that Gly225 and Gly226 play an important role in determining the substrate stereospecificity of the enzyme. Additionally, the G225P/G226P mutation of the enzyme reduced the affinity (K(m)) for both 3alpha- and 17alpha-hydroxysteroid substrates by up to 160-fold, indicating that these residues are critical for the binding of substrates.
Mouse 3(17)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C21) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyses the oxidoreduction of the 3- and 17-hydroxy/keto groups of steroid substrates such as oestrogens, androgens and neurosteroids. The structure of the AKR1C21-NADPH binary complex was determined from an orthorhombic crystal belonging to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) at a resolution of 1.8 A. In order to identify the factors responsible for the bifunctionality of AKR1C21, three steroid substrates including a 17-keto steroid, a 3-keto steroid and a 3alpha-hydroxysteroid were docked into the substrate-binding cavity. Models of the enzyme-coenzyme-substrate complexes suggest that Lys31, Gly225 and Gly226 are important for ligand recognition and orientation in the active site."

The aim of this study was to resequence 3 candidate genes, CETP, LIPC, and LIPG, which encode cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase, respectively, in Thai subjects with HALP and compare them to normolipidemic controls. Sequence variants of CETP, LIPC, and LIPG were identified by sequencing exons and exon-intron junctions in 64 subjects with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) and compared to those of 113 normolipidemic subjects. Two heterozygous frameshift mutations in CETP (p.Leu262ProfsX31 and p.Val411ArgfsX6) and two heterozygous missense mutations in LIPC (p.Gly141Ser and p.Val173Met) were found. One deletion mutation and 3 point mutations in the CETP promoter were also identified. Collectively, these rare mutations were found only in the HALP group but not in the control group (8% vs 0%, p = 0.0056). One common variant of CETP (p.Asp459Gly) was found at a higher frequency in the HALP group (23% vs 4%, p = 0.000074). Altogether, rare variants of CETP or LIPC and/or the common CETP p.Asp459Gly variant were found in 30% of the HALP group and 4% of the controls (p = 0.0000014). No rare variant of LIPG was identified. In conclusion, common and rare genetic variants in CETP and LIPC, but not LIPG, were more commonly found in the Thai HALP group, which could potentially contribute to high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol phenotypes in this population."

Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including ~50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10-13), increased MMA% (P = 2x10-16) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10-23). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10-5). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5´-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.
To establish a three-step programmed method to find gene mutations related to maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Target region capture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed using customized oligonucleotide probes designed to capture suspected genes for MODY in 11 probands with clinically diagnosed MODY. The suspected associations of certain genes with MODY were then confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the probands and their family members. Finally, to validate variants of one of the genes of interest (glucokinase, GCK) as pathogenic mutations, protein function editing by the variant genes was assessed. In the target region capture and NGS phase, a total of nine variants of seven genes (GCK, WFS1, SLC19A2, SH2B1, SERPINB4, RFX6, and GATA6) were identified in eight probands. Two heterozygous GCK mutations located on the same allele (p.Leu77Arg and p.Val101Met) were identified in a MODY family. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the variants identified by NGS to be present in probands and their diabetic family members, but not in non-diabetic family members. Finally, enzyme kinetic and thermal stability analyses revealed that the p.Leu77Arg mutation or the p.Leu77Arg mutation in combination with the p.Val101Met mutation inactivates GCK function and stability, while mutation of p.Val101Met alone does not. The p.Leu77Arg but not p.Val101Met GCK mutation is therefore considered a pathogenic mutation associated with MODY. Genetic screening coupled with gene-editing protein function testing is an effective and reliable method by which causative gene mutations of MODY can be identified."

This interaction activates cell signaling and attenuates inflammatory responses. We screened 14-mer PrPC-derived peptides and identified a putative LRP1 recognition motif in the PrPC sequence spanning residues 98-111. A synthetic peptide (P3) corresponding to this region replicated the cell-signaling and biological activities of full-length shed PrPC. P3 blocked LPS-elicited cytokine expression in macrophages and microglia and rescued the heightened sensitivity to LPS in mice in which the PrPC gene (Prnp) had been deleted. P3 activated ERK1/2 and induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The response to P3 required LRP1 and the NMDA receptor and was blocked by the PrPC-specific antibody, POM2. P3 has Lys residues, which are typically necessary for LRP1 binding. Converting Lys100 and Lys103 into Ala eliminated the activity of P3, suggesting that these residues are essential in the LRP1-binding motif. A P3 derivative in which Lys105 and Lys109 were converted into Ala retained activity. We conclude that the biological activities of shed PrPC, attributed to interaction with LRP1, are retained in synthetic peptides, which may be templates for therapeutics development.
Prion protein is composed of a structure-unsolved N-terminal domain and a globular C-terminal domain. Under limited trypsin digestion, mouse recombinant prion protein can be cleaved into two parts at residue Lys105. Here, we termed these two fragments as the N-domain (sequence 23-105) and the C-domain (sequence 106-230). In this study, the structural properties of the N-domain, the C-domain, and the full-length protein were explored using small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and the 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid binding assay. The conformation and size of the prion protein were found to change sensitively under the solvent conditions. The positive residues in the sequence 23-99 of the N-domain were found to be responsible for the enhanced flexibility with the salt concentration reduced below 5 mM. The C-domain containing a hydrophobic patch tends to unfold and aggregate during a salt-induced structural collapse. The N-domain collapsed together with the C-domain at pH 5.2, whereas it collapsed independently at pH 4.2. The positively charged cluster (sequence 100-105) in the N-domain contributed to protecting the exposed hydrophobic surface of the C-domain.
Endonuclease III (EndoIII) is nearly ubiquitous in all three domains of life. EndoIII family proteins exhibit a bifunctional (glycosylase/lyase) activity on oxidative/saturated pyrimidine bases, such as thymine glycol. Previous studies on EndoIII homologs have reported the presence of important residues involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. However, a biochemical clarification of the roles of these residues as well as details of their evolutionary conservation is still lacking. This is particularly true for archaeal orthologs. The current study demonstrated the roles of the evolutionarily conserved residues of euryarchaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis EndoIII (TkoEndoIII). We utilized amino acid sequence analysis and homology modeling to identify highly conserved regions with potential key residues in the EndoIII proteins. Using Ala-substituted TkoEndoIII mutant proteins, residues of interest were quantitatively examined via DNA binding, glycosylase/AP lyase/bifunctional activity, and DNA trapping assays. The obtained results allowed us to determine the roles, as well as the significance of these roles in Schiff base formation (Lys140 as a nucleophile and Asp158), Tg recognition (His160), substrate binding (Arg59, Leu101, Trp102, and Gly136), β-elimination activities (Ser57 and Asp62), and [4Fe-4S] cluster formation (Cys208 and Cys215). Interestingly, a critical role played by the highly conserved Lys105 (predicted as being away from the catalytic site) in substrate binding, accompanied by a significant indirect effect on catalytic activity, were detected. Our results suggest that these particular residues play conserved roles among EndoIII orthologs across the domains. In addition to identifying the critical role of the highly conserved Lys105, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the functions attributable to the evolutionarily conserved residues found in the EndoIII family, from Escherichia coli to humans.
Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is cross-linked and dysfunctional in human atheroma. Although multiple mechanisms of apoA-I cross-linking have been demonstrated in vitro, the in vivo mechanisms of cross-linking are not well-established. We have recently demonstrated the highly selective and efficient modification of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apoproteins by endogenous oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs), including γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids. In the current study, we report that γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids effectively cross-link apoproteins in HDL. We further demonstrate that cross-linking impairs the cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I or HDL3 in vitro and in vivo Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we analyzed the pattern of apoprotein cross-linking in isolated human HDL either by synthetic γ-ketoalkenal phospholipids or by oxPLs generated during HDL oxidation in plasma by the physiologically relevant MPO-H2O2-NO2- system. We found that five histidine residues in helices 5-8 of apoA-I are preferably cross-linked by oxPLs, forming stable pyrrole adducts with lysine residues in the helices 3-4 of another apoA-I or in the central domain of apoA-II. We also identified cross-links of apoA-I and apoA-II with two minor HDL apoproteins, apoA-IV and apoE. We detected a similar pattern of apoprotein cross-linking in oxidized murine HDL. We further detected oxPL cross-link adducts of HDL apoproteins in plasma and aorta of hyperlipidemic LDLR-/- mice, including cross-link adducts of apoA-I His-165-apoA-I Lys-93, apoA-I His-154-apoA-I Lys-105, apoA-I His-154-apoA-IV Lys-149, and apoA-II Lys-30-apoE His-227. These findings suggest an important mechanism that contributes to the loss of HDL's atheroprotective function in vivo.
ROCK1 and ROCK2 are highly homologous isoforms. Accumulated studies indicate that they have distinct different functions, and the development of isoform selective ROCK inhibitors will pave new roads for the treatment of various diseases. In this work, a series of amide-chroman derivatives were synthesized and biologically evaluated in order to develop potent and isoform selective ROCK2 inhibitors. Remarkably, (S)-6-methoxy-chroman-3-carboxylic acid (4-pyridin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide ((S)-7c) possessed ROCK2 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3 nM and 22.7-fold isoform selectivity (vs. ROCK1). Molecular docking indicated that hydrophobic interactions were the key element for the high potency and isoform selectivity of (S)-7c. The binding free energies predicted by MM/GBSA were in good agreement with the experimental bioactivities, and the analysis of individual energy terms suggested that residue Lys105 in ROCK1 or Lys121 in ROCK2 was the key residue for the isoform selectivity of (S)-7c."

The origin of the enzyme's powerful role in accelerating chemical reactions is one of the most critical and still widely discussed questions. It is already accepted that enzymes impose an electrostatic field onto their substrates by adopting complex three-dimensional structures; therefore, the preorganization of electric fields inside protein active sites has been proposed as a crucial contributor to catalytic mechanisms and rate constant enhancement. In this work, we focus on three catalytically active β-subunits of 20S proteasomes with low sequence identity (∼30%) whose active sites, although situated in an electrostatically miscellaneous environment, catalyze the same chemical reaction with similar catalytic efficiency. Our in silico experiments reproduce the experimentally observed equivalent reactivity of the three sites and show that obliteration of the electrostatic potential in all active sites would deprive the enzymes of their catalytic power by slowing down the chemical process by a factor of 1035. To regain enzymatic efficiency, besides catalytic Thr1 and Lys33 residues, the presence of aspartic acid in position 17 and an aqueous solvent is required, proving that the electrostatic potential generated by the remaining residues is insignificant for catalysis. Moreover, it was found that the gradual decay of atomic charges on Asp17 strongly correlates with the enzyme's catalytic rate deterioration as well as with a change in the charge distributions due to introduced mutations. The computational procedure used and described here may help identify key residues for catalysis in other biomolecular systems and consequently may contribute to the process of designing enzyme-like synthetic catalysts.
Recently, targeted protein degradation has attracted increasing interest as a new drug discovery approach. This method aims to control the function of drug targets by inducing their degradation through protein degradation systems such as the proteasome. Concurrently, compounds that enhance proteasome activity have also garnered attention. In 2023, we reported that anthricin (also known as 4-deoxypodophyllotoxin), a natural product that belongs to the lignan family, enhances proteasome activity. However, whether this enhancement was because of increased proteasome expression or improved proteasome function remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationship of anthricin and its analogs in enhancing proteasome activity, the effects of anthricin on proteasome-related gene expression, and the direct binding between anthricin and the proteasome using pull-down assay. Moreover, we assessed the interaction between anthricin and the proteasome using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that anthricin does not induce proteasome-related gene expression, but instead binds to the β-subunit of the proteasome, bringing the side chains of three amino acid residues (Thr1, Asp17, and Lys33) at the catalytic site closer together, thereby inducing a hyperactive state. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest the mechanism of proteasome activity enhancement by anthricin at the molecular level. The findings could contribute to the development of new chemotypes to enhance the effects of targeted protein degraders by regulating proteasome activity.

Solution-phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled to native ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) can provide complementary structural information about the conformational dynamics of biological molecules. In the present work, the solution-stable isotope labeling (SIL) combined with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) in tandem with top-down electron capture dissociation (ECD) is illustrated for the structural characterization of the solution native states of ubiquitin. Four different ubiquitin electrospray solution conditions: (i) single-tip nondeuterated, (ii) theta tip for online SIL HDX, (iii) single-tip SIL-deuterated, and (iv) theta tip for online SIL H/D back exchange (HDbX), were investigated to assess the H/D exchange reactivities of native ubiquitin. The combination of TIMS and ECD in a q-ToF MS instrument allowed for additional inspection of gas-phase HDbX added by top-down fragmentation, revealing the exposed and protected residues with limited scrambling effects (e.g., intramolecular H/D migration). A native charge state distribution (5+ to 7+) and TIMS profiles were observed under the single-tip nondeuterated solution conditions. Mass shift distributions of ∼40, ∼104, and ∼87D were observed when incorporating deuterium for online SIL HDX, SIL HDX, and online SIL HDbX, respectively, while retaining similar conformational states. ECD fragmentation allowed for the localization of the deuterated labeled residues of the peptide fragments, with a sequence coverage of ∼90%, for each of the ubiquitin solution condition. Changes in the TIMS trapping time settings (∼70 to ∼795 ms) were used to determine the H/D back exchange dynamics of native ubiquitin. HDbX-TIMS-q-ECD-MS/MS exhibited H/D back exchanges in the six-residue C-terminal tail as well as around Lys6, Lys11, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63 residues, indicating that these regions are the most exposed area (less protected hydrogens) of ubiquitin as compared to the rest of the core residues that adopt a compact β-grasp fold (protected hydrogens), which was consistent with the accessible surface area of ubiquitin. The present data highlight for the first time consistency between the solution HDX and gas-phase HDbX-TIMS data for native studies."

Since 2004, an increasing number of calves have been identified in a Lidia herd with signs of severe growth retardation, respiratory alterations and juvenile lethality, which constitutes a novel inherited syndrome in cattle and was subsequently termed growth and respiratory lethal syndrome. We performed a genome-wide association study on a cohort of 13 affected calves and 24 putative non-carrier parents, mapping the disease to a wide 6 cM region on bovine chromosome 3 (p < 10-7 ). Whole genome re-sequencing of three affected calves and three putative non-carrier parents identified a novel missense variant (c.149G>A|p.Cys50Tyr) in exon 2 of the endothelin 2 (EDN2) gene. Bioinformatic analyses of p.Cys50Tyr effects predicted them to be damaging for both the structure and the function of the edn2 protein, and to create a new site of splicing that may also affect the pattern of pre-mRNA splicing and exon definition. Sanger sequencing of this variant on the rest of the sample set confirmed the segregation pattern obtained with whole genome re-sequencing. The identification of the causative variant and the development of a diagnostic genetic test enable the efficient design of matings to keep the effective population size as high as possible, as well as providing insights into the first EDN2-associated hereditary disease in cattle or other species."

We carried out protein stability measurements, X-ray crystallographic analyses, and free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulation. The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated that the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants were, respectively, 1.9 and 3.2 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein (WT). The overall structures of the mutants were almost identical to that of WT, in spite of the disruption of the hydrogen bonding between the side-chain O-H group of Thr29 and the main-chain C=O group of Glu25. To analyze the stabilization mechanism of the mutants, we performed free energy calculations. The calculated free energy differences were in good agreement with the experimental values. The stabilization of the mutants was mainly caused by solvation loss in the denatured state. Furthermore, the O-H group of Thr29 favorably interacts with the C=O group of Glu25 to form hydrogen bonds and, simultaneously, unfavorably interacts electrostatically with the main-chain C=O group of Thr29. The difference in the free energy profile of the unfolding path between WT and the Thr29Ile mutant is discussed in light of our experimental and theoretical results."

The kinetic parameters values using pNPG as substrate were Km (0.28 mM), Vmax (43.8 μmol/min/mg), kcat (38.43 s-1) and kcat/Km (135.5 s-1 mM-1). The BglA9 was active in a broad pH range and had an activity half-life around 24 h at 50 °C. The de-glycosylation efficiency of BglA9 for polydatin was determined by estimating the amount of glucose released after enzymatic reaction by a dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay. The kinetic parameters of BglA9 for polydatin were 5.5 mM, 20.84 μmol/min/mg, 18.28 s-1and 3.27 s-1 mM-1 for Km, Vmax, kcat, and kcat/Km values, respectively. The Ki value for glucose was determined to be 1.7 M. The residues Gln19, His120, Glu355, Glu409, Glu178, Asn222 may play a crucial role in the deglycosylation as revealed by the 3D structure of enzyme docked with polydatin.
Glycoside hydrolase family 15 (GH15) inverting enzymes contain two glutamate residues functioning as a general acid catalyst and a general base catalyst, for isomaltose glucohydrolase (IGHase), Glu178 and Glu335, respectively. Generally, a two-catalytic residue-mediated reaction exhibits a typical bell-shaped pH-activity curve. However, IGHase is found to display atypical non-bell-shaped pH-kcat and pH-kcat /Km profiles, theoretically better-fitted to a three-catalytic residue-associated pH-activity curve. We determined the crystal structure of IGHase by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using sulfur atoms and the cocrystal structure of a catalytic base mutant E335A with isomaltose. Although the activity of E335A was undetectable, the electron density observed in its active site pocket did not correspond to an isomaltose but a glycerol and a β-glucose, cryoprotectant, and hydrolysis product. Our structural and biochemical analyses of several mutant enzymes suggest that Tyr48 acts as a second catalytic base catalyst. Y48F mutant displayed almost equivalent specific activity to a catalytic acid mutant E178A. Tyr48, highly conserved in all GH15 members, is fixed by another Tyr residue in many GH15 enzymes; the latter Tyr is replaced by Phe290 in IGHase. The pH profile of F290Y mutant changed to a bell-shaped curve, suggesting that Phe290 is a key residue distinguishing Tyr48 of IGHase from other GH15 members. Furthermore, F290Y is found to accelerate the condensation of isomaltose from glucose by modifying a hydrogen-bonding network between Tyr290-Tyr48-Glu335. The present study indicates that the atypical Phe290 makes Tyr48 of IGHase unique among GH15 enzymes.
The β-glucosidase derived from microorganisms has attracted worldwide interest for their industrial applications, but studies on β-glucosidases from Oenococcus oeni are rare. In this paper, catalytic mechanism of a novel β-glucosidase BGL0224 of Oenococcus oeni SD-2a was explored for the first time by kinetic parameters determination, fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching mechanism analysis, molecular dynamics simulation. The results indicated that BGL0224 had universal catalytic effect on different types of glycoside substrates, but the catalytic efficiencies were different. Fluorescence quenching analysis results suggested that the quenching processes between BGL0224 and seven kinds of substrates were predominated by the static quenching mechanism. A reasonable three-dimensional model of BGL0224 was obtained using the crystal structure of E.coli BglA as a template. The analysis results of molecular simulation (RMSD, Rg, RMSF and hydrogen bonding) showed that the composite system 'BGL0224-pNPG' was very stable after 40 ns. The catalytic process of BGL0224 acting on 'p-Nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside' conformed to the double displacement mechanism. Two glutamic acid residues 'Glu178 and Glu377' played a vital role in the whole catalytic process. Overall, this study gave specific insights on the catalytic mechanism of BGL0224, which was of great significance for developing its potential applications in food industry.
The tripartite EfeUOB system functions as a low pH iron importer in Gram-negative bacteria. In the alginate-assimilating bacterium Sphingomonas sp. strain A1, an additional EfeO-like protein (Algp7) is encoded downstream of the efeUOB operon. Here we show the metal binding mode of Algp7, which carries a M_75 metallopeptidase motif. The Algp7 protein was purified from recombinant E. coli cells and was subsequently characterized using differential scanning fluorimetry, fluorescence spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. The fluorescence of a dye, SYPRO Orange, bound to denatured Algp7 in the absence and presence of metal ions was measured during heat treatment. The fluorescence profile of Algp7 in the presence of metals such as ferric, ferrous, and zinc ions, shifted to a higher temperature, suggesting that Algp7 binds these metal ions and that metal ion-bound Algp7 is more thermally stable than the ligand-free form. Algp7 was directly demonstrated to show an ability to bind copper ion by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Crystal structure of metal ion-bound Algp7 revealed that the metal ion is bound to the cleft surrounded by several acidic residues. Four residues, Glu79, Glu82, Asp96, and Glu178, distinct from the M_75 motif (His115xxGlu118), are coordinated to the metal ion. This is the first report to provide structural insights into metal binding by the bacterial EfeO element.
The bacterial flagellar type III export apparatus, which is required for flagellar assembly beyond the cell membranes, consists of a transmembrane export gate complex and a cytoplasmic ATPase complex. FlhA, FlhB, FliP, FliQ, and FliR form the gate complex inside the basal body MS ring, although FliO is required for efficient export gate formation in Salmonella enterica. However, it remains unknown how they form the gate complex. Here we report that FliP forms a homohexameric ring with a diameter of 10 nm. Alanine substitutions of conserved Phe-137, Phe-150, and Glu-178 residues in the periplasmic domain of FliP (FliPP) inhibited FliP6 ring formation, suppressing flagellar protein export. FliO formed a 5-nm ring structure with 3 clamp-like structures that bind to the FliP6 ring. The crystal structure of FliPP derived from Thermotoga maritia, and structure-based photo-crosslinking experiments revealed that Phe-150 and Ser-156 of FliPP are involved in the FliP-FliP interactions and that Phe-150, Arg-152, Ser-156, and Pro-158 are responsible for the FliP-FliO interactions. Overexpression of FliP restored motility of a ∆fliO mutant to the wild-type level, suggesting that the FliP6 ring is a functional unit in the export gate complex and that FliO is not part of the final gate structure. Copurification assays revealed that FlhA, FlhB, FliQ, and FliR are associated with the FliO/FliP complex. We propose that the assembly of the export gate complex begins with FliP6 ring formation with the help of the FliO scaffold, followed by FliQ, FliR, and FlhB and finally FlhA during MS ring formation."

β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KasA I) enzyme is crucial in mycolic acid synthesis via catalytic condensation reactions, hence implicated in M. tuberculosis's virulence and drug resistance. Presently, there is no known potent KasA inhibitor; thiolactomycin lacks potency. Recently reported indazole compounds JSF-3285/tr1DG167 and 5G/tr2DG167 inhibit the KasA through binding to the substrate cavity. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear, and the unknown resistance mechanisms raise concerns about JSF-3285's novelty.
C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor 1 (C5aR1) is an important target in anti-inflammatory therapeutics. The cyclic peptide antagonist PMX53 binds to the orthosteric site located in the extracellular vestibule of C5aR1, and the non-peptide antagonist NDT9513727 binds to the allosteric site formed by the middle region of TM3 (trans-membrane helix), TM4, and TM5. We catch a sight of the variational binding mode of PMX53 during the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamic (GaMD) simulations. In the binary complex of C5aR1 and PMX53, the PMX53 takes a dynamic binding mechanism during the simulation. Namely, the side chain of Arg6 of PMX53 extends to TM6-TM7 (pose 1) or swings to TM5 (pose 2), forming a salt bridge with Glu199. Meanwhile, in the ternary complex of C5aR1 with PMX53 and NDT9513727, the side chain of Arg6 of PMX53 swings to TM5 (pose 2) from extending to TM6-TM7 (pose 1) at the beginning of the GaMD simulation. In subsequent simulation, PMX53 stabilizes in the pose 2 binding mode by forming a stable salt bridge with Glu199. The free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations demonstrate that pose 1 (ΔGbinding = -10.94 kcal/mol) is more stable in the binary complex and pose 2 (ΔGbinding = -7.91 kcal/mol) is unstable because of highly dynamic TM5. NDT9513727 interacts directly with TM4 and TM5 and stabilizes the hydrophobic stack between the extracellular sides of the two helices. Therefore, pose 2 (ΔGbinding = -16.27 kcal/mol) is notably stable than pose 1 (ΔGbinding = -9.78 kcal/mol) in the ternary complex. The identification of a novel binding mode of PMX53 and the detailed structural information of PMX53 interacting with a receptor obtained by GaMD simulations will be helpful in designing potent antagonists of C5aR1.
The complex pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prompted researchers to develop multitarget-directed molecules to find an effective therapy against the disease. In this context, a novel series of N-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-5-arylisoxazole-3-carboxamide derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). In vitro biological evaluation demonstrated that compound 4e was the best AChE (IC50  = 16.07 μM) and BuChE inhibitor (IC50  = 15.16 μM). A kinetic study of 4e was also conducted, which presented a mixed-type inhibition for both enzymes. Molecular docking studies revealed that compound 4e fitted well into the active sites of AChE and BuChE, forming stable and strong interactions with key residues Glu199, Trp84, Asp72, Tyr121, and Phe288 in AChE and His438, Trp82, Ala328, Tyr332, Phe329, Thr120, and Pro285 in BuChE. Besides, the inhibition of BACE1 by 4e and the biometal chelation activity of 4e were measured. The neuroprotective assessment revealed that 4e exhibited 23.2% protection at 50 µM toward amyloid-beta-induced PC12 neuronal cells. Overall, this study exhibited that compound 4e was a promising compound targeting multiple factors associated with AD.
Oviduct-specific glycoprotein (OVGP1) is a high molecular weight chitinase-like protein belonging to GH18 family. It is secreted by non-ciliated epithelial cells of oviduct during estrous cycle providing an essential milieu for fertilization and embryo development. The present study reports the characterization of buffalo OVGP1 through structural modeling, carbohydrate-binding properties and evolutionary analysis. Structural model displayed the typical fold of GH18 family members till the boundary of chitinase-like domain further consisting of a large (β/α)8 TIM barrel sub-domain and a small (α+β) sub-domain. Two critical catalytic residues were found substituted in the catalytic centre (Asp to Phe118, Glu to Leu120) compared with the active chitinase. The carbohydrate-binding groove in TIM barrel was lined with various conserved aromatic residues. Molecular docking with different sugars revealed the involvement of various residues in hydrogen-bonding and non-bonded contacts. Most of the substrate-binding residues were conserved except for a few replacements (Ser13, Lys48, Asp49, Pro50, Asp167, Glu199, Gln272 and Phe275) in comparison with other GH18 members. The residues Trp10, Trp79, Asn80, Gln272, Phe275 and Trp334 were involved in recognition of all six ligands. The α+β sub-domain participated in sugar-binding through Thr270, Gln272, Tyr242 and Phe275. The binding assays revealed significant sugar-binding with purified native and recombinant OVGP1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OVGP1 was closely related to AMCases followed by other CLPs and evolution of OVGP1 occurred through several gene duplications. This is the first study describing the structural characteristics of OVGP1 that will further help to understand its interaction with gametes to perform crucial reproductive functions."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25688103/","Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is a major cause of primary lactic acidemia resulting in high morbidity and mortality, with limited therapeutic options. PDHA1 mutations are responsible for >82% of cases. The E1 component of PDC is a symmetric dimer of heterodimers (αβ/α'β') encoded by PDHA1 and PDHB. We measured solvent accessibility surface area (SASA), utilized nearest-neighbor analysis, incorporated sequence changes using mutagenesis tool in PyMOL, and performed molecular modeling with SWISS-MODEL, to investigate the impact of residues with disease-causing missense variants (DMVs) on E1 structure and function. We reviewed 166 and 13 genetically resolved cases due to PDHA1 and PDHB, respectively, from variant databases. We expanded on 102 E1α and 13 E1β nonduplicate DMVs. DMVs of E1α Arg112-Arg224 stretch (exons 5-7) and of E1α Arg residues constituted 40% and 39% of cases, respectively, with invariant Arg349 accounting for 22% of arginine replacements. SASA analysis showed that 86% and 84% of residues with nonduplicate DMVs of E1α and E1β, respectively, are solvent inaccessible (""buried""). Furthermore, 30% of E1α buried residues with DMVs are deleterious through perturbation of subunit-subunit interface contact (SSIC), with 73% located in the Arg112-Arg224 stretch. E1α Arg349 represented 74% of buried E1α Arg residues involved in SSIC. Structural perturbations resulting from residue replacements in some matched neighboring pairs of amino acids on different subunits involved in SSIC at 2.9-4.0 Å interatomic distance apart, exhibit similar clinical phenotype. Collectively, this work provides insight for future target-based advanced molecular modeling studies, with implications for development of novel therapeutics for specific recurrent DMVs of E1α.
The bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP) FlrC, controls motility and colonization of Vibrio cholerae by regulating the transcription of class-III flagellar genes in σ54-dependent manner. However, the mechanism by which FlrC regulates transcription is not fully elucidated. Although, most bEBPs require nucleotides to stimulate the oligomerization necessary for function, our previous study showed that the central domain of FlrC (FlrCC) forms heptamer in a nucleotide-independent manner. Furthermore, heptameric FlrCC binds ATP in ""cis-mediated"" style without any contribution from sensor I motif 285REDXXYR291 of the trans protomer. This atypical ATP binding raises the question of whether heptamerization of FlrC is solely required for transcription regulation, or if it is also critical for ATPase activity. ATPase assays and size exclusion chromatography of the trans-variants FlrCC-Y290A and FlrCC-R291A showed destabilization of heptameric assembly with concomitant abrogation of ATPase activity. Crystal structures showed that in the cis-variant FlrCC-R349A drastic shift of Walker A encroached ATP-binding site, whereas the site remained occupied by ADP in FlrCC-Y290A. We postulated that FlrCC heptamerizes through concentration-dependent cooperativity for maximal ATPase activity and upon heptamerization, packing of trans-acting Tyr290 against cis-acting Arg349 compels Arg349 to maintain proper conformation of Walker A. Finally, a Trp quenching study revealed binding of cyclic-di-GMP with FlrCC Excess cyclic-di-GMP repressed ATPase activity of FlrCC through destabilization of heptameric assembly, especially at low concentration of protein. Systematic phylogenetic analysis allowed us to propose similar regulatory mechanisms for FlrCs of several Vibrio species and a set of monotrichous Gram-negative bacteria.
Inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a novel strategy for cancer therapy, but only two inhibitors of NAMPT (FK866 and CHS828) have progressed into clinical trials. This study seeks to compare a novel potent NAMPT inhibitor, MS0, with a classical inhibitor FK866 in their biological activity and molecular binding mode, thereby contributing to future chemical optimization and a further understanding of the action mode of NAMPT inhibitors. The IC50 values of MS0 and FK866 in inhibition of recombinant human NAMPT activity were 9.08±0.90 and 1.60±0.32 nmol/L, respectively. Consistently, FK866 exerted better antiproliferation in 6 human cancer cell lines (HepG2, A2780, 95-D, A549, U2OS and U266) than MS0 with IC50 values nearly 12-fold to 225-fold lower than those of MS0. Co-crystal structures of wild-type human NAMPT complexed with MS0 or FK866 were elucidated, which revealed that MS0 did not interact with Ser241. The hydrogen bond mediated by crystallographic water between MS0 and His191 or Val350 of NAMPT did not exist in FK866. Instead, FK866 exhibited hydrophobic interactions with Arg349. Based on the activity assays and crystal structure analyses, we elaborate the reason why the antiproliferation activity of MS0 was not as good as that of FK866, which would contributes to the current understanding of the mode of action of NAMPT inhibitors and will also contribute to further development of anticancer drugs in the future.
Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) carry out the first step of protein biosynthesis. Several aaRSs are multimeric, and coordination between the dynamics of active sites present in each monomer is a prerequisite for the fast and accurate aminoacylation. However, important lacunae of understanding exist concerning the conformational dynamics of multimeric aaRSs. Questions remained unanswered pertaining to the dynamics of the active site. Little is known concerning the conformational dynamics of the active sites in response to the substrate binding, reorganization of the catalytic residues around reactants, time-dependent changes at the reaction center, which are essential for facilitating the nucleophilic attack, and interactions at the interface of neighboring monomers. In the present work, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of dimeric (mk)SerRS from Methanopyrus kandleri bound with tRNA using an explicit solvent system. Two dimeric states of seryl tRNA synthetase (open, substrate bound, and adenylate bound) and two monomeric states (open and substrate bound) are simulated with bound tRNA. The aim is to understand the conformational dynamics of (mk)SerRS during its reaction cycle. While the present results provide a clear dynamical perspective of the active sites of (mk)SerRS, they corroborate with the results from the time-averaged experimental data such as crystallographic and mutation analysis of methanogenic SerRS from M. kandleri and M. barkeri. It is observed from the present simulation that the motif 2 loop gates the active site and its Glu351 and Arg360 stabilizes ATP in a bent state favorable for nucleophilic attack. The flexibility of the walls of the active site gradually reduces near reaction center, which is a more organized region compared to the lid region. The motif 2 loop anchors Ser and ATP using Arg349 in a hydrogen bonded geometry crucial for nucleophilic attack and favorably influences the electrostatic potential at the reaction center. Synchronously, Arg366 of the β sheet at the base holds the syn oxygen of the attacking carboxylic group so that the attack by the anti oxygen is feasible. This residue also contributes to the reduction of the unfavorable electrostatic potential at the reaction center. Present simulation clearly shows the catalytic role of the residues at reaction center. A precise and stable geometry of hydrogen bonded network develops within the active site, which is essential for the development of an optimum transition state geometry. All loops move away from the platform of active site in the open or adenylate bound state and the network of hydrogen bond disappears. The serine binding site is most rigid among all three subsites. The Ser is held here in a highly organized geometry bound by Zn(2+) and Cys residues. Present simulation further suggests that the helix-turn-helix motif connecting the monomers might have important role in coordinating the functional dynamics of the two active sites. The N-terminal domain is involved in long-range electrostatic interaction and specific hydrogen bond interaction (both direct and water mediated) with tRNA. Overall conformational fluctuation is less in the N terminal compared to the catalytic domain due to the presence of a motif 2 loop, loop f, and serine ordering loop, which change conformation in the later domain during the reaction cycle. The dynamic perspective of the active site of (mk)SerRS with the mobile loop acting as the gate and dynamically silent β sheets performing as the base has similarity with the perception of the active site in various other enzymes.
Bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) oligomerize through AAA(+) domains and use ATP hydrolysis-driven energy to isomerize the RNA polymerase-σ(54) complex during transcriptional initiation. Here, we describe the first structure of the central AAA(+) domain of the flagellar regulatory protein FlrC (FlrC(C)), a bEBP that controls flagellar synthesis in Vibrio cholerae. Our results showed that FlrC(C) forms heptamer both in nucleotide (Nt)-free and -bound states without ATP-dependent subunit remodeling. Unlike the bEBPs such as NtrC1 or PspF, a novel cis-mediated ""all or none"" ATP binding occurs in the heptameric FlrC(C), because constriction at the ATPase site, caused by loop L3 and helix α7, restricts the proximity of the trans-protomer required for Nt binding. A unique ""closed to open"" movement of Walker A, assisted by trans-acting ""Glu switch"" Glu-286, facilitates ATP binding and hydrolysis. Fluorescence quenching and ATPase assays on FlrC(C) and mutants revealed that although Arg-349 of sensor II, positioned by trans-acting Glu-286 and Tyr-290, acts as a key residue to bind and hydrolyze ATP, Arg-319 of α7 anchors ribose and controls the rate of ATP hydrolysis by retarding the expulsion of ADP. Heptameric state of FlrC(C) is restored in solution even with the transition state mimicking ADP·AlF3. Structural results and pulldown assays indicated that L3 renders an in-built geometry to L1 and L2 causing σ(54)-FlrC(C) interaction independent of Nt binding. Collectively, our results underscore a novel mechanism of ATP binding and σ(54) interaction that strives to understand the transcriptional mechanism of the bEBPs, which probably interact directly with the RNA polymerase-σ(54) complex without DNA looping."

Three L. rigidum populations (R1, R2, and R3) collected from Australian grain fields were identified with trifluralin resistance. Both target-site and nontarget-site resistance mechanisms were investigated. No target-site α-tubulin mutations were detected in populations R1 and R3, while an Arg-243-Lys mutation was found in R2. Compared with the three trifluralin-susceptible populations, enhanced [14C]-trifluralin metabolism, quantified by measuring the amount of [14C] label partitioning into the polar phase of a hexane:methanol system, was identified in all the three resistant populations. This is the first report of metabolic resistance to trifluralin. Coevolution of target-site and nontarget-site resistance to trifluralin is occurring, and metabolic resistance is not rare in L. rigidum populations in Australia. A method was established for trifluralin metabolic resistance detection, overcoming the difficulties of quantifying this highly volatile herbicide by chromatographic methods."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385444/","The exonuclease ISG20L2 has been initially characterized for its role in the mammalian 5.8S rRNA 3' end maturation, specifically in the cleavage of ITS2 of 12S precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). Here, we show that human ISG20L2 is also involved in 18S pre-rRNA maturation through removing the ITS1 region, and contributes to ribosomal biogenesis and cell proliferation. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the ISG20L2 nuclease domain at 2.9 Å resolution. It exhibits the typical αβα fold of the DEDD 3'-5' exonuclease with a catalytic pocket located in the hollow near the center. The catalytic residues Asp183, Glu185, Asp267, His322 and Asp327 constitute the DEDDh motif in ISG20L2. The active pocket represents conformational flexibility in the absence of an RNA substrate. Using structural superposition and mutagenesis assay, we mapped RNA substrate binding residues in ISG20L2. Finally, cellular assays revealed that ISG20L2 is aberrantly up-regulated in colon adenocarcinoma and promotes colon cancer cell proliferation through regulating ribosome biogenesis. Together, these results reveal that ISG20L2 is a new enzymatic member for 18S pre-rRNA maturation, provide insights into the mechanism of ISG20L2 underlying pre-rRNA processing, and suggest that ISG20L2 is a potential therapeutic target for colon adenocarcinoma.
Porphyromonas gingivalis is a bacterial species known to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis, that more recently has been as well associated with Alzheimer's disease. P. gingivalis expresses a glutaminyl cyclase (PgQC) whose human ortholog is known to participate in the beta amyloid peptide metabolism. We have elucidated the crystal structure of PgQC at 1.95 Å resolution in unbound and in inhibitor-complexed forms. The structural characterization of PgQC confirmed that PgQC displays a mammalian fold rather than a bacterial fold. Our biochemical characterization indicates that PgQC uses a mammalian-like catalytic mechanism enabled by the residues Asp149, Glu182, Asp183, Asp218, Asp267 and His299. In addition, we could observe that a non-conserved Trp193 may drive differences in the binding affinity of ligands which might be useful for drug development. With a screening of a small molecule library, we have identified a benzimidazole derivative rendering PgQC inhibition in the low micromolar range that might be amenable for further medicinal chemistry development.
The type II sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPT2A) mediates renal phosphate uptake. The NPT2A is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23, which requires Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1), a multidomain PDZ-containing phosphoprotein. Phosphocycling controls the association between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Here, we characterize the critical involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6A (GRK6A) in mediating PTH-sensitive phosphate transport by targeted phosphorylation coupled with NHERF1 conformational rearrangement, which in turn allows phosphorylation at a secondary site. GRK6A, through its carboxy-terminal PDZ recognition motif, binds NHERF1 PDZ1 with greater affinity than PDZ2. However, the association between NHERF1 PDZ2 and GRK6A is necessary for PTH action. Ser162, a PKCα phosphorylation site in PDZ2, regulates the binding affinity between PDZ2 and GRK6A. Substitution of Ser162 with alanine (S162A) blocks the PTH action but does not disrupt the interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A. Replacement of Ser162 with aspartic acid (S162D) abrogates the interaction between NHERF1 and the NPT2A and concurrently PTH action. We used amber codon suppression to generate a phosphorylated Ser162(pSer162)-PDZ2 variant. KD values determined by fluorescence anisotropy indicate that incorporation of pSer162 increased the binding affinity to the carboxy terminus of GRK6A 2-fold compared with WT PDZ2. Molecular dynamics simulations predict formation of an electrostatic network between pSer162 and Asp183 of PDZ2 and Arg at position -1 of the GRK6A PDZ-binding motif. Our results suggest that PDZ2 plays a regulatory role in PTH-sensitive NPT2A-mediated phosphate transport and phosphorylation of Ser162 in PDZ2 modulates the interaction with GRK6A.
Phospholipase B (EC 3.1.1.5) are a distinctive group of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acids esterified at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions forming free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The structural information and catalytic mechanism of phospholipase B are still not clear. Herein, we reported a putative phospholipase B (TmPLB1) from Talaromyces marneffei GD-0079 synthesized by genome mining library. The gene (TmPlb1) was expressed and the TmPLB1 was purified using E. coli shuffle T7 expression system. The putative TmPLB1 was purified by affinity chromatography with a yield of 13.5%. The TmPLB1 showed optimum activity at 35 °C and pH 7.0. The TmPLB1 showed enzymatic activity using Lecithin (soybean > 98% pure), and the hydrolysis of TmPLB1 by 31P NMR showed phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a major phospholipid along with lyso-phospholipids (1-LPC and 2-LPC) and some minor phospholipids. The molecular modeling studies indicate that its active site pocket contains Ser125, Asp183 and His215 as the catalytic triad. The structure dynamics and simulations results explained the conformational changes associated with different environmental conditions. This is the first report on biochemical characterization and structure dynamics of TmPLB1 enzyme. The present study could be helpful to utilize TmPLB1 in food industry for the determination of food components containing phosphorus. Additionally, such enzyme could also be useful in Industry for the modifications of phospholipids.
L-type voltage gated calcium channels play essential role in contraction of various skeletal and vascular smooth muscles, thereby plays important role in regulating blood pressure. Dihydropyridine receptors have been targeted for development of newer antihypertensive agents, one of the structurally analogs nucleus dihydropyrimidines have been reported earlier by us as a potential agent toward development of calcium channel modulator. A pre-synthetic QSAR was run and on the basis of structure activity relationship a series of twenty three molecules was synthesized and studied by myosin light chain kinase assay (MLCK), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) colorimetric assay, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and invasive blood pressure (IBP) methods. Molecules with significant efficacy were studied for their single crystal X-ray diffraction, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and post-synthetic QSAR. The NIBP and IBP methods screened molecules with better percentage inhibition versus time compared to standard drug Nifedipine. The lead compound ethyl 2-methyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-4H-pyrimido [2,1-b] [1,3] benzothiazole-3-carboxylate (26) presented a triclinic structure with polymeric chain packing in lattice. 26 exhibited IC50 on MLCK assay of 2.1±1.7 μM with selectivity of L-type calcium channels and comparative to Nifedipine. It offered satisfactory physicochemical properties with partition coefficient of (ClogP) 4.64. Its pharmacokinetic profile is also good with Cmax at 0.40 μg/ml by oral route with Tmax reaching in 0.5 h which means in 30 min. 26 also exhibits superior t1/2 of 5.4 h and oral bioavailability of (F) 56.75% with an AUC0-∞ of 0.84 μg h/ml. Molecular docking studies indicates toward the interaction of lead compound via hydrogen bonds with Lys144, Glu181 and Asp183, it forms the Van der Walls interactions with Ser18, Asp20, Asn187, Pro185, Glu180, Glu181 and Arg10 with Glide score and Glide energy to be -3.602 and -47.098, respectively. Post-synthetic QSAR of newly synthesized molecules indicates toward improvement with respect to steric descriptor which contributed negatively in former series."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094694/","The translocation of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is critical for its activation and plays a key role in tumor progression. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the nuclear import of YAP are not fully understood. In this study, we have uncovered a crucial role of SOX9 in the activation of YAP. SOX9 promotes the nuclear translocation of YAP by direct interaction. Importantly, we have identified that the binding between Asp-125 of SOX9 and Arg-124 of YAP is essential for SOX9-YAP interaction and subsequent nuclear entry of YAP. Additionally, we have discovered a novel asymmetrical dimethylation of YAP at Arg-124 (YAP-R124me2a) catalyzed by PRMT1. YAP-R124me2a enhances the interaction between YAP and SOX9 and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers. Furthermore, we disrupted the interaction between SOX9 and YAP using a competitive peptide, S-A1, which mimics an α-helix of SOX9 containing Asp-125. S-A1 significantly inhibits YAP nuclear translocation and effectively suppresses tumor growth. This study provides the first evidence of SOX9 as a pivotal regulator driving YAP nuclear translocation and presents a potential therapeutic strategy for YAP-driven human cancers by targeting SOX9-YAP interaction.
Cancer is a complex multifactorial disease whose pathophysiology involves multiple metabolic pathways, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, for which several proteasome inhibitors have already been approved for clinical use. However, the resistance to existing therapies and the occurrence of severe adverse effects is still a concern. The purpose of this study was the discovery of novel scaffolds of proteasome inhibitors with anticancer activity, aiming to overcome the limitations of the existing proteasome inhibitors. Thus, a structure-based virtual screening protocol was developed using the structure of the human 20S proteasome, and 246 compounds from virtual databases were selected for in vitro evaluation, namely proteasome inhibition assays and cell viability assays. Compound 4 (JHG58) was shortlisted as the best hit compound based on its potential in terms of proteasome inhibitory activity and its ability to induce cell death (both with IC50 values in the low micromolar range). Molecular docking studies revealed that compound 4 interacts with key residues, namely with the catalytic Thr1, Ala20, Thr21, Lys33, and Asp125 at the chymotrypsin-like catalytic active site. The hit compound is a good candidate for additional optimization through a hit-to-lead campaign.
Increased scientific interest has led to the rise in biotechnological uses of halophilic and halotolerant microbes for hypersaline wastewater bioremediation. Hence, this study performed molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and validation by Molecular Mechanic Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations on the DehH2 from Bacillus thuringiensis H2. We aimed to identify the interactions of DehH2 with substrates haloacids, haloacetates, and chlorpyrifos under extreme salinity (35% NaCl). MD simulations revealed that DehH2 preferentially degraded haloacids and haloacetates (-6.3 to -4.7 kcal/mol) by forming three or four hydrogen bonds to the catalytic triad, Asp125, Arg201, and Lys202. Conversely, chlorpyrifos was the least preferred substrate in both MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations. MD simulation results ranked the DehH2-L-2CP complex (RMSD □0.125-0.23 nm) as the most stable while the least was the DehH2-chlorpyrifos complex (RMSD 0.32 nm; RMSF 0.0 - 0.29). The order of stability was as follows: DehH2-L-2CP > DehH2-MCA > DehH2-D-2CP > DehH2-3CP > DehH2-2,2-DCP > DehH2-2,3-DCP > DehH2-TCA > DehH2-chlorpyrifos. The MM-PBSA calculations further affirmed the DehH2-L-2CP complex's highest stability with the lowest binding energy of -45.14 kcal/mol, followed closely by DehH2-MCA (-41.21 kcal/mol), DehH2-D-2CP (-31.59 kcal/mol), DehH2-3CP (-30.75 kcal/mol), DehH2-2,2- DCP (-29.72 kcal/mol), DehH2-2,3-DCP (-22.20 kcal/mol) and DehH2-TCA (-18.46 kcal/mol). The positive binding energy of the DehH2-chlorpyrifos complex (+180.57 kcal/mol) proved the enzyme's non-preference for the substrate. The results ultimately illustrated the unique specificity of the DehH2 to degrade the above-said pollutants under a hypersaline condition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
Fasciola hepatica is a global parasite of humans and their livestock. Regulation of parasite-secreted cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases associated with virulence is important to fine-tune parasite-host interaction. We uncovered a family of seven Kunitz-type (FhKT) inhibitors dispersed into five phylogenetic groups. The most highly expressed FhKT genes (group FhKT1) are secreted by the newly excysted juveniles (NEJs), the stage responsible for host infection. The FhKT1 inhibitors do not inhibit serine proteases but are potent inhibitors of parasite cathepsins L and host lysosomal cathepsin L, S and K cysteine proteases (inhibition constants < 10 nM). Their unusual inhibitory properties are due to (a) Leu15 in the reactive site loop P1 position that sits at the water-exposed interface of the S1 and S1' subsites of the cathepsin protease, and (b) Arg19 which forms cation-π interactions with Trp291 of the S1' subsite and electrostatic interactions with Asp125 of the S2' subsite. FhKT1.3 is exceptional, however, as it also inhibits the serine protease trypsin due to replacement of the P1 Leu15 in the reactive loop with Arg15. The atypical Kunitz-type inhibitor family likely regulate parasite cathepsin L proteases and/or impairs host immune cell activation by blocking lysosomal cathepsin proteases involved in antigen processing and presentation.
The high dependency and surplus use of agrochemical products have liberated enormous quantities of toxic halogenated pollutants into the environment and threaten the well-being of humankind. Herein, this study performed molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) calculations on the DehH2 from Bacillus thuringiensis, to identify the order of which the enzyme degrades different substrates, haloacids, haloacetate and chlorpyrifos. The study discovered that the DehH2 favored the degradation of haloacids and haloacetates (-3.3 - 4.6 kcal/mol) and formed three hydrogen bonds with Asp125, Arg201 and Lys202. Despite the inconclusive molecular docking result, chlorpyrifos was consistently shown to be the least favored substrate of the DehH2 in MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations. Results of MD simulations revealed the DehH2-haloacid- (RMSD 0.15 - 0.25 nm) and DehH2-haloacetates (RMSF 0.05 - 0.25 nm) were more stable, with the DehH2-L-2CP complex being the most stable while the least was the DehH2-chlorpyrifos (RMSD 0.295 nm; RMSF 0.05 - 0.59 nm). The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area calculations showed the DehH2-L-2CP complex (-24.27 kcal/mol) having the lowest binding energy followed by DehH2-MCA (-22.78 kcal/mol), DehH2-D-2CP (-21.82 kcal/mol), DehH2-3CP (-21.11 kcal/mol), DehH2-2,2-DCP (-18.34 kcal/mol), DehH2-2,3-DCP (-8.34 kcal/mol), DehH2-TCA (-7.62 kcal/mol), while chlorpyrifos was unable to spontaneously bind to DehH2 (+127.16 kcal/mol). In a nutshell, the findings of this study offer valuable insights into the rational tailoring of the DehH2 for expanding its substrate specificity and catalytic activity in the near future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In a recent work, our group designed a set of potential dual inhibitors predicted to occupy an allosteric back pocket near the active site of both enzymes, but their dynamic and unbinding behavior was unclear. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) and metadynamics (meta-D) simulations to study two of these virtual candidates (herein called IQ2 and IQ3). Their binding mode was predicted to be similar to that observed in LQ5 and BAX, well-known back-pocket binders of CDK2 and VEGFR2, respectively, including H-bonding with critical residues such as Leu83/Cys113 and Asp145/Asp190 (but excepting H-bonding with Glu51/Glu111) in CDK2/VEGFR2, correspondingly. Likewise, while LQ5 and BAX unbound through the allosteric channel as expected for type-IIA inhibitors, IQ2 and IQ3 unbound via the ATP channel (except for CDK2-IQ2) as expected for type-I½A inhibitors. Interestingly, a C-C single/double bond difference between IQ2/IQ3, respectively, resulted associated with differences in the AS/T loop flexibility observed for CDK2. These insights will help developing scaffold modifications during an optimization stage, serving as a starting point to develop dual kinase inhibitors in challenging biological targets with a promising anticancer potential.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH(3')-IIIa) kinases form a clinically central group of antibiotic-resistant enzymes. Computationally, we have studied the catalytic mechanism of the APH(3')-IIIa enzyme at the atomic-level. The proposed reaction mechanism involves protonation of Asp190 by the kanamycin 3'-hydroxyl group mediated through an explicit neighboring water molecule, which leads to a simultaneous nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of the ATP by the deprotonated kanamycin 3'-hydroxyl group. The second step is a proton abstraction from the protonated Asp190 to the phosphate group of the phosphorylated kanamycin mediated by an explicit water molecule. The calculated Gibbs energy of activation (ΔG⧧) of the rate-determining step for the phosphorylation reaction is 77 kJ mol-1 at the M06-2X/6-311++G(2df,p)//ONIOM(M06-2X/6-31+G(d):HF/6-31G(d)) level of theory. This study has provided a new understanding of the APH(3')-IIIa catalytic mechanism that agrees with the available experimental data (ΔG⧧ = 75 ± 4 kJ mol-1) and could provide a starting point for the rational design of mechanism-based inhibitors of aminoglycoside modifying enzyme to circumvent antibiotic resistance.
The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) with bactericidal and endotoxin-neutralizing activity is of considerable interest in clinical applications. However, the crucial residues responsible for the bactericidal activity of BPI remain elusive. In previous study, we identified the mutation of mBPI5 associated with the male infertility of mice. Here, the effects of Asp190Ala mutation on the antibacterial activity of mBPI5 have been determined. Substitution of Asp190 by alanine caused significant improvement in cytotoxic effect toward both E.coli J5 and P.aeruginosa. Liposome co-sedimentation assay showed that the ratio of Asp190Ala mutant binding to lipids increased by 8 folds. These results were well consistent with known fact that antibacterial activity of BPI is attributed to its high affinity for lipid moiety of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The constructed structure of mBPI5 revealed that Asp190 was located close to 6 positively charged residues on the surface of N-terminal domain. When replacing Asp190 with alanine, salt linkages with Arg188 were broken, making the side chain of Arg188 be free to move and form tighter contacts with negatively charged LPS. These findings suggest that residue 190 combined with surrounding positively charged residues largely contribute to bactericidal and endotoxin-neutralizing activities of mBPI5.
Influenza virus continues to evolve due to changes in the genome and the new strain of virus is more pathogenic then the previous strain. These changes may also help the virus to cross specie barrier and may also affect the binding pattern of virus.The main theme of the current study is the identification of changes in the hemagglutinin sequence of H1N1 virus from 1960 to 2011 and also how these changes affect the binding properties of virus. From 1960 to 2000 following important changes were observed: Ala198Asp and Gly225Glu in 1980; and Gly225Asp in 1999. From 1999 to 2011 many changes were observed, most of the changes were transient, but two of the changes, Gly225Asp and Ala227Glu, were consistent in the period of 1999-2010. These residues make the binding stronger. The important conserved residues are Asp190, Tyr98, His183 and Gln226. The current study will provide an understanding how virus evolve with the passage of time. The current study also helps to understand the changes in the binding pattern of virus. It will also help for the identification of new therapeutic targets.
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is one of the key members of the antioxidant defense enzyme family, however, data regarding to the immune function of MnSOD in mollusks still remain limited now. In this study, a full-length MnSOD cDNA was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method from cDNA library of ark shell Scapharca broughtonii (termed SbMnSOD). The cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 696 bp which encoded a polypeptide of 232 amino acids, a 5'-UTR with length of 32 bp and a 3'-UTR of 275 bp. Four putative amino acid residues (His-57, His-105, Asp-190 and His-194) responsible for manganese coordination were located in the most highly conserved regions of SbMnSOD and the signature sequence (DVWEHAYY) also existed in SbMnSOD. The deduced amino acid sequence of SbMnSOD shared high homology to MnSOD from other species. All those data revealed that the SbMnSOD was a novel member of the MnSOD family. The mRNA expression profiles of SbMnSOD in tissues of foot, gill, mantle, adductor muscle, hemocytes and hepatopancreas analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) suggested the mRNA transcripts of SbMnSOD distributed in all the examined tissues. Importantly, Vibrio anguillarum challenge resulted in the increased expression of SbMnSOD mRNA with a regular change trend in all examined tissues, indicating SbMnSOD actively participated in the immune response process. What's more, further analysis on the antibacterial activity of the recombinant SbMnSOD showed that the fusion protein could remarkably inhibit growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The present results clearly suggested that SbMnSOD was an acute phase protein involved in the immune reaction in S. broughtonii."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8652527/","Parvoviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause fatal disease in cats. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) is a primitive virus reported first and canine parvovirus (CPV) evolved from FPV and was reported later. Both induce disease in cats and dogs with correlative signs. FPV in domestic cats is genetically diverse and some strains may differ from those used for vaccination. In this study, a virus of FPV strain, ABT/MVC/2022/FPV/001, was identified from a fecal sample of the suspected cat with severe haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. The phylogenetic analysis and complete genome sequence of the strain share 99.75% nucleotide identity with FPV variant MH559110 belonging to Tamil Nadu, India. The results also reveal similarities to strains isolated from Italy, Belgium, and China. The deduced amino acid sequence of isolated strain revealed specific amino acid substitution (Pro5Ala, Phe6Val, His7Gln, Asn9Asp, Lys16Arg, Lys19Arg, Asn52Lys, Gly58Trp, Thr66Ser, Lys67Arg, Leu70His, Asn373Asp and Ala390Thr) which differed from MH559110 and other strains. The complete genomic analysis revealed that the FPV strain circulating in India is evolving rapidly with unique antigenic variations between field FPV, CPV and vaccine strains which may be the major cause for vaccine failure in vaccinated cats.
The structural transformation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase upon binding of the allosteric regulator AMP dramatically changes the interactions across the C1-C4 (C2-C3) subunit interface of the enzyme. Asn9, Met18, and Ser87 residues were modified by site-directed mutagenesis to probe the function of the interface residues in porcine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The wild-type and mutant forms of the enzyme were purified to homogeneity and characterized by initial rate kinetics and circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry. No discernible alterations in structure were observed among the wild-type and Asn9Asp, Met18Ile, Met18Arg, and Ser87Ala mutant forms of the enzyme as measured by CD spectrometry. Kinetic analyses revealed 1.6- and 1.8-fold increases in kcat with Met18Arg and Asn9Asp, respectively. The K(m) for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increased about 2-approximately 4-fold relative to that of the wild-type enzyme in the four mutants. A 50-fold lower Ka value for Mg2+ compared with that of the wild-type enzyme was obtained for Met18Ile with no alteration of the Ki for AMP. However, the replacement of Met18 with Arg caused a dramatic decrease in AMP affinity (20 000-fold) without a change in Mg2+ affinity. Increases of 6- and 2-fold in the Ki values for AMP were found with Asn9Asp and Ser87Ala, respectively. There was no difference in the cooperativity for AMP inhibition between the wild-type and the mutant forms of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This study demonstrates that the mutation of residues in the C1-C4 (C2-C3) interface of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase can significantly affect the affinity for Mg2+, which is presumably bound 30 A away. Moreover the mutations alternatively reduce AMP and Mg2+ affinities, and this finding may be associated with the destabilization of the corresponding allosteric states of the enzyme. The kinetics and structural modeling studies of the interface residues provide new insights into the conformational equilibrium of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."

Despite previous investigations exploring interactions between HDAC7 and MEF2, a detailed characterization of the HDAC7-MEF2 functional complex is still lacking. Herein, we first modeled the structure of the HDAC7-MEF2A complex and investigated the inter-protein interactions using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified specific amino acids within HDAC7 and MEF2A that participate in interactions such as salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. Our results reveal a salt bridge formed between LYS96(HDAC7) and ASP63(MEF2A). Our analysis also predicted formations of reliable hydrogen bonds between SER82(HDAC7) and ASP63(MEF2A) as well as LYS96(HDAC7) and ASP63(MEF2A). In addition, clustering of hydrophobic residues at the interface contributes in stabilizing the HDAC7-MEF2A complex. Results from multiple sequence alignment show that most of the HDAC7 residues that are predicted to associate with MEF2A are conserved in at least three class IIa HDACs and all predicted residues in MEF2A are conserved in MEF2s. We also found that the association of DNA to MEF2A has no significant effect on HDAC7-MEF2A interactions. Our results may also provide useful insights into the interactions between other class IIa HDACs and MEF2s.
In this study, the hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase CLA-DH from Lactobacillus plantarump-8 and its four mutant variants were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3). UV spectrophotometry was employed to verify the catalytic power of the purified CLA-DH to convert ricinoleic acid into 12-oxo-cis-9-octadecenoic acid in the presence of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The optimum reaction temperature for CLA-DH was 45°C, with a maintained stability between 20°C and 40°C. The optimal pH for CLA-DH catalytic activity was 6.0-7.0, with a maintained stability at a pH range of 6.0-8.0. In addition, Fe3+ promoted enzyme activity, whereas Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+ inhibited enzyme activity (P < 0.05). The Km, Vmax, Kcat, and Kcat/Km of CLA-DH were determined as 2.19 ± 0.34 μM, 2.06 ± 0.28 μM min-1, 2.00 ± 0.27 min-1, and 0.92 ± 0.02 min-1μM-1, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that both Tyr156 and Ser143 residues play significant roles in the catalysis of CLA-DH, and its solubility is affected by Lys160 and Asp63. Moreover, Gas chromatography determined that recombinant CLA-DH could be successfully applied to Conjugated linoleic acids production.
Tryptophan synthase catalyzes the last two steps of tryptophan biosynthesis in plants, fungi and bacteria. It consists of two protein chains, designated α and β, encoded by trpA and trpB genes, that function as an αββα complex. Structural and functional features of tryptophan synthase have been extensively studied, explaining the roles of individual residues in the two active sites in catalysis and allosteric regulation. TrpA serves as a model for protein-folding studies. In 1969, Jackson and Yanofsky observed that the typically monomeric TrpA forms a small population of dimers. Dimerization was postulated to take place through an exchange of structural elements of the monomeric chains, a phenomenon later termed 3D domain swapping. The structural details of the TrpA dimer have remained unknown. Here, the crystal structure of the Streptococcus pneumoniae TrpA homodimer is reported, demonstrating 3D domain swapping in a TIM-barrel fold for the first time. The N-terminal domain comprising the H0-S1-H1-S2 elements is exchanged, while the hinge region corresponds to loop L2 linking strand S2 to helix H2'. The structural elements S2 and L2 carry the catalytic residues Glu52 and Asp63. As the S2 element is part of the swapped domain, the architecture of the catalytic apparatus in the dimer is recreated from two protein chains. The homodimer interface overlaps with the α-β interface of the tryptophan synthase αββα heterotetramer, suggesting that the 3D domain-swapped dimer cannot form a complex with the β subunit. In the crystal, the dimers assemble into a decamer comprising two pentameric rings.
Neuroglobin is a heme protein present in the nervous system cells of mammals and other organisms. Although cytoprotective effects of neuroglobin on neuronal damage have been reported, the physiological mechanisms of neuroglobin function remain unknown. In recent years, a role for neuroglobin as a reductant for extramitochondrial cytochrome c has been proposed. According to this hypothesis, cytoplasmic neuroglobin can interact with cytochrome c released from the mitochondria and reduce its heme group to the ferrous state, thus preventing cytochrome c-dependent assembly of the apoptosome. The interaction of neuroglobin and cytochrome c has been studied by surface plasmon resonance techniques and molecular dynamics, however the empirical evidence on the specific residues of neuroglobin and cytochrome c involved in the interaction is scarce and indirect. This study analyzes the role of five negatively charged residues in the neuroglobin surface putatively involved in the interaction with cytochrome c - Glu60, Asp63, Asp73, Glu 87 and Glu151 - by site-directed mutagenesis. Characterization of the electron transfer between neuroglobin mutants and cytochrome c indicates that Asp73 is critical for the interaction, and Glu60, Asp63 and Glu87 also contribute to the neuroglobin-cytochrome c interaction. Based on the results, structures and binding surfaces for the neuroglobin-cytochrome c complex compatible with the experimental observations are proposed. These data can guide further studies on neuroglobin function and its involvement in cytochrome c signaling cascades.
Alphavirus non-structural protein, nsP1 has a distinct molecular mechanism of capping the viral RNAs than the conventional capping mechanism of host. Thus, alphavirus capping enzyme nsP1 is a potential drug target. nsP1 catalyzes the methylation of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by transferring the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to a GTP molecule at its N7 position with the help of nsP1 methyltransferase (MTase) followed by guanylylation (GT) reaction which involves the formation of m7GMP-nsP1 covalent complex by nsP1 guanylyltransferase (GTase). In subsequent reactions, m7GMP moiety is added to the 5' end of the viral ppRNA by nsP1 GTase resulting in the formation of cap0 structure. In the present study, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) nsP1 MTase and GT reactions were confirmed by an indirect non-radioactive colorimetric assay and western blot assay using an antibody specific for the m7G cap, respectively. The purified recombinant CHIKV nsP1 has been used for the development of a rapid and sensitive non-radioactive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify the inhibitors of CHIKV nsP1. The MTase reaction is followed by GT reaction and resulted in m7GMP-nsP1 covalent complex formation. The developed ELISA nsP1 assay measures this m7GMP-nsP1 complex by utilizing anti-m7G cap monoclonal antibody. The mutation of a conserved residue Asp63 to Ala revealed its role in nsP1 enzyme reaction. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was used to determine the presence of magnesium ions (Mg2+) in the purified nsP1 protein. The divalent metal ion selectivity and investigation show preference for Mg2+ ion by CHIKV nsP1. Additionally, using the developed ELISA nsP1 assay, the inhibitory effects of sinefungin, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) and ribavirin were determined and the IC50 values were estimated to be 2.69 μM, 5.72 μM and 1.18 mM, respectively."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36426151/","Ancylostoma species are parasitic nematodes that release a multitude of proteins to manipulate host immune responses to facilitate their survival. Among the released proteins, Ancylostoma-secreted protein 5 (ASP5) plays a pivotal role in mediating host-parasite interactions, making it a promising target for interventions against canine hookworm infections caused by Ancylostoma species. Antibody phage display, a widely used method for generating human monoclonal antibodies was employed in this study. A bacterial expression system was used to produce ASP5 for biopanning. A single-chain fragment variable (scFv) monoclonal antibody against ASP5 was generated from the naïve Human AntibodY LibrarY (HAYLY). The resulting scFv antibody was characterized to elucidate its antigen-binding properties. The identified monoclonal antibody showed good specificity and binding characteristics which highlights its potential for diagnostic applications for hookworm infections.
Current antidepressant therapy shows substantial limitations, and there is an urgent need for the development of new treatment strategies for depression. Stressful events and hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. HPA axis activity is self-regulated by negative feedback at several levels including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-mediated feedback. Here, we investigated whether noncorticotropic synthetic analogs of the ACTH(4-10) fragment, ACTH(4-7)-Pro-Gly-Pro (Semax) and Ac-Nle4-cyclo[Asp5-His6-D-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9-Lys10]ACTH(4-10)-NH2 (Melanotan II (MTII), a potent agonist of melanocortin receptors), have potential antidepressant activity in a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rat model of depression. Stressed and control male adult Sprague-Dawley rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or a low dose (60 nmol/kg of body weight (BW)) of Semax or MTII. Rats were monitored for BW and hedonic status, as measured in the sucrose preference test. We found that chronic treatment with Semax and MTII reversed or substantially attenuated CUS-induced anhedonia, BW gain suppression, adrenal hypertrophy and a decrease in the hippocampal levels of BDNF. In the forced swim test, no effects of the CUS procedure or peptides on the duration of rat immobility were detected. Our findings show that in the CUS paradigm, systemically administered ACTH(4-10) analogs Semax and MTII exert antidepressant-like effects on anhedonia and hippocampal BDNF levels, and attenuate markers of chronic stress load, at least in male rats. The results support the argument that ACTH(4-10) analogs and other noncorticotropic melanocortins may have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment and prevention of depression and other stress-related pathologies.
The cyclic peptide c[d-Lys2, Asp5]-DN-9 has recently been identified as a multifunctional opioid/neuropeptide FF receptor agonist, displaying potent analgesic activity with reduced side effects. This study utilized Tyr-c[d-Lys-Gly-Phe-Asp]-d-Pro-NH2 (0), a cyclic hexapeptide derived from the opioid pharmacophore of c[d-Lys2, Asp5]-DN-9, as a chemical template. We designed, synthesized, and characterized 22 analogs of 0 with a single amino acid substitution to investigate its structure-activity relationship. Most of these cyclic hexapeptide analogs exhibited multifunctional activity at μ and δ opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively) and produced antinociceptive effects following subcutaneous administration. The lead compound analog 15 showed potent agonistic activities at the MOR, κ opioid receptor (KOR), and DOR in vitro and produced a strong and long-lasting analgesic effect through peripheral MOR and KOR in the tail-flick test. Further biological evaluation identified that analog 15 did not cause significant side effects such as tolerance, withdrawal, or reward liability.
Our previous study reported the multifunctional agonist for opioid and neuropeptide FF receptors DN-9, along with its cyclic peptide analogues c[D-Cys2, Cys5]-DN-9 and c[D-Lys2, Asp5]-DN-9. These analogues demonstrated potent antinociceptive effects with reduced opioid-related side effects. To develop more stable and effective analgesics, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated seven hydrocarbon-stapled cyclic peptides based on DN-9. In vitro calcium mobilization assays revealed that most of the stapled peptides, except 3, displayed multifunctional agonistic activities at opioid and neuropeptide FF receptors. Subcutaneous administration of all stapled peptides resulted in effective and long-lasting antinociceptive activities lasting up to 360 min. Among these stapled peptides, 1a and 1b emerged as the optimized compounds, producing potent central antinociception following subcutaneous, intracerebroventricular, and oral administrations. Additionally, subcutaneous administration of 1a and 1b caused nontolerance antinociception, with limited occurrence of constipation and addiction. Furthermore, 1a was selected as the final optimized compound due to its wider safety window compared to 1b.
Akebia trifoliata is a novel edible and healthy fruit. Here, we found that this fruit had the highest content of total free amino acids and three aromatic amino acids (AAAs) compared with the other popular fruits, and there was an obvious inverse relationship between AAA and flavonoid levels in various fruit tissues. Multiomics analysis revealed that the evolutionarily strengthened synthetic pathway of all three AAAs, the largely regulating ability conferred by ASP5 in the arogenate pathway and the complementary phenylpyruvate pathway endorsed by ADT of both Phe and Tyr biosynthesis provided reasonable explanations for the high AAA content in the flesh of A. trifoliata fruit. Gene-specific expression could be the main reason for the inverse relationship between AAAs and flavonoids. This study will help us understand the metabolic mechanism of AAAs and to develop A. trifoliata as a fresh fruit crop and medicinal plant by molecular breeding strategies."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33810550/","A bio-assay guided fractionation strategy based on cholinesterase assay combined with 13C NMR-based dereplication was used to identify active metabolites from the bark of Mesua lepidota. Eight compounds were identified with the aid of the 13C NMR-based dereplication software, MixONat, i.e., sitosterol (1), stigmasterol (2), α-amyrin (3), friedelin (6), 3β-friedelinol (7), betulinic acid (9), lepidotol A (10) and lepidotol B (11). Further bio-assay guided isolation of active compounds afforded one xanthone, pyranojacareubin (12) and six coumarins; lepidotol A (10), lepidotol B (11), lepidotol E (13), lepidotin A (14), and lepidotin B (15), including a new Mammea coumarin, lepidotin C (16). All the metabolites showed strong to moderate butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition. Lepidotin B (15) exhibited the most potent inhibition towards BChE with a mix-mode inhibition profile and a Ki value of 1.03 µM. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that lepidotin B (15) forms stable interactions with key residues within five critical regions of BChE. These regions encompass residues Asp70 and Tyr332, the acyl hydrophobic pocket marked by Leu286, the catalytic triad represented by Ser198 and His438, the oxyanion hole (OH) constituted by Gly116 and Gly117, and the choline binding site featuring Trp82. To gauge the binding strength of lepidotin B (15) and to pinpoint pivotal residues at the binding interface, free energy calculations were conducted using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) approach. This analysis not only predicted a favourable binding affinity for lepidotin B (15) but also facilitated the identification of significant residues crucial for the binding interaction.
The enhancement of cholinergic functions via acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibition is considered a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of ZINC390718, previously filtered using computational approaches, on both cholinesterases and to characterize, using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the possible binding mode of this compound inside the cholinesterase enzymes. The in vitro cytotoxicity effect was also investigated using a primary astrocyte-enriched glial cell culture. ZINC390718 presented in vitro dual inhibitory activity against AChE at a high micromolar range (IC50 = 543.8 µM) and against BuChE (IC50 = 241.1 µM) in a concentration-dependent manner, with greater activity against BuChE. The MD simulation revealed that ZINC390718 performed important hydrophobic and H-bond interactions with the catalytic residue sites on both targets. The residues that promoted the hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding in the AChE target were Leu67, Trp86, Phe123, Tyr124, Ser293, Phe295, and Tyr341, and on the BuChE target, they were Asp70, Tyr332, Tyr128, Ile442, Trp82, and Glu197. The cytotoxic effect of Z390718, evaluated via cell viability, showed that the molecule has low in vitro toxicity. The in vitro and in silico results indicate that ZINC390718 can be used as chemotype for the optimization and identification of new dual cholinesterase inhibitors.
The structure of allergenic proteins provides important information about the binding of allergens to antibodies. In this study, the crystal structure of Scy p 4 with a resolution of 1.60 Å was obtained by X-ray diffraction. Epitope mapping of Scy p 4 revealed that linear epitopes are located on the surface of Scy p 4. Also, conformational epitopes are mostly located in the structural conservative region. Further structural comparison, surface electrostatic potential, and hydrogen bond force analysis showed that mutation of Asp70 and Asp18/20/70 would lead to calcium-binding capacity being lost and destruction of allergenicity. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of structure showed that sarcoplasmic-calcium-binding protein (SCP) had high sequence, secondary, and spatial structural identity in crustaceans, which may be an important factor leading to cross-reactivity among crustaceans. The structure of Scy p 4 provides a template for epitope evaluation and localization of SCPs, which will help to reveal cross-reactivity among species.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon with an unmet need for therapeutic targets. Ethyl gallate (EG) is a natural small molecule for UC treatment, but its cellular target is unknown. By labelling EG with a diazirine photocrosslinker and a click chemistry handle, we identified phosphatidyl-ethanolamine binding protein1 (PEBP1) as a direct cellular target of EG by forming hydrogen bonds with Asp70 and Tyr120. In particular, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicated that EG induced the sequence (residues 141-153) embedding to inhibit S153 phosphorylation of PEBP1. Additionally, the EG-mediated sequence (residues 108-122) exposure significantly enhanced PEBP1-Raf-1 interaction to block the downstream NF-κB inflammatory pathway in macrophages. Moreover, PEBP1 siRNA substantially reversed the EG-dependent down-regulation of the phosphorylation of IKKβ, IκBα and NF-κB, demonstrating that the NF-κB signal functioned as an essential anti-inflammation mechanism of PEBP1. Collectively, we revealed PEBP1 as a previously undescribed cellular target in macrophages for UC therapy and identified a new allosteric site for PEBP1 biology study using EG as a chemical probe.
A library of novel 4-{[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]amino}-2-hydroxybenzoic acid amides was designed and synthesized in order to provide potential acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE/BChE) inhibitors; the in vitro inhibitory profile and selectivity index were specified. Benzyl (3-hydroxy-4-{[2-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamoyl}phenyl)carbamate was the best AChE inhibitor with the inhibitory concentration of IC50 = 36.05 µM in the series, while benzyl {3-hydroxy-4-[(2-methoxyphenyl)carbamoyl]phenyl}-carbamate was the most potent BChE inhibitor (IC50 = 22.23 µM) with the highest selectivity for BChE (SI = 2.26). The cytotoxic effect was evaluated in vitro for promising AChE/BChE inhibitors. The newly synthesized adducts were subjected to the quantitative shape comparison with the generation of an averaged pharmacophore pattern. Noticeably, three pairs of fairly similar fluorine/bromine-containing compounds can potentially form the activity cliff that is manifested formally by high structure-activity landscape index (SALI) numerical values. The molecular docking study was conducted for the most potent AChE/BChE inhibitors, indicating that the hydrophobic interactions were overwhelmingly generated with Gln119, Asp70, Pro285, Thr120, and Trp82 aminoacid residues, while the hydrogen bond (HB)-donor ones were dominated with Thr120. π-stacking interactions were specified with the Trp82 aminoacid residue of chain A as well. Finally, the stability of chosen liganded enzymatic systems was assessed using the molecular dynamic simulations. An attempt was made to explain the noted differences of the selectivity index for the most potent molecules, especially those bearing unsubstituted and fluorinated methoxy group."

T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein 3 (Tim-3), also known as Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, has been discovered to have a negative regulatory effect on murine T-cell responses. Galectin-9 exhibits various biological effects, including cell aggregation, eosinophil chemoattraction, activation, and apoptosis, observed in murine thymocytes, T-cells, and human melanoma cells. Such approach demonstrated that Galectin-9 acts as a binding partner on Tim-3 and mediates the T-cell inhibitory effects. Tl-gal is a homologous protein to galectin-9, isolated from the adult stage of the canine gastrointestinal nematode parasite Toxascaris leonina. However, molecular mechanism between Tim-3 and galectin-9 is still remain unknown. Here, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray structures and interactions of the Tim-3 and Tl-gal complex as well as their biochemical and biophysical characterization. In the structure, Ser46 residue of Tl-gal NCRD was bound to Asp25 residue of hTim-3. Compared to our previous study, the binding site of the complex is the same as the sugar binding site (the Ser46 residue) of Tl-gal. In addition, analysis of the complex structure revealed that the four Tl-gal molecules were in an open form packing and one mTim-3 peptide was bound to one Tl-gal molecule. These observations suggest that how Tl-gal binds hTim3 is essential to understanding the molecular mechanism for the Tim-3-galectin 9 interaction that regulates immune responses. This could potentially serve as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.
Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) is a protein kinase that phosphorylates p53-Ser46 and induces apoptosis in response to DNA damage. However, the relationship between DYRK2 expression and chemosensitivity after DNA damage in colorectal cancer has not been well investigated. The aim of the present study was to examine whether DYRK2 could be a novel marker for predicting chemosensitivity after 5-fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage in colorectal cancer. Here we showed that DYRK2 knockout decreased the chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in p53 wild-type colorectal cancer cells, whereas the chemosensitivity remained unchanged in p53-deficient/mutated colorectal cancer cells. In addition, no significant differences in chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin between scramble and siDYRK2 p53(-/-) colorectal cancer cells were observed. Conversely, the combination of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DYRK2 with 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin enhanced apoptosis and chemosensitivity through p53-Ser46 phosphorylation in p53 wild-type colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, DYRK2 knockout decreased chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in p53 wild-type xenograft mouse models. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that DYRK2 expression was associated with chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in p53 wild-type colorectal cancer, suggesting the importance of evaluating the p53 status and DYRK2 expression as a novel marker in therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer.
Glycolytic intermediary metabolites such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate can serve as signals, controlling metabolic states beyond energy metabolism. However, whether glycolytic metabolites also play a role in controlling cell fate remains unexplored. Here, we find that low levels of glycolytic metabolite 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) can switch phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) from cataplerosis serine synthesis to pro-apoptotic activation of p53. PHGDH is a p53-binding protein, and when unoccupied by 3-PGA interacts with the scaffold protein AXIN in complex with the kinase HIPK2, both of which are also p53-binding proteins. This leads to the formation of a multivalent p53-binding complex that allows HIPK2 to specifically phosphorylate p53-Ser46 and thereby promote apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that PHGDH mutants (R135W and V261M) that are constitutively bound to 3-PGA abolish p53 activation even under low glucose conditions, while the mutants (T57A and T78A) unable to bind 3-PGA cause constitutive p53 activation and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, even in the presence of high glucose. In vivo, PHGDH-T57A induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth of diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC, whereas PHGDH-R135W prevents apoptosis and promotes HCC growth, and knockout of Trp53 abolishes these effects above. Importantly, caloric restriction that lowers whole-body glucose levels can impede HCC growth dependent on PHGDH. Together, these results unveil a mechanism by which glucose availability autonomously controls p53 activity, providing a new paradigm of cell fate control by metabolic substrate availability."

These pharmacological benefits have been documented in vitro and in vivo, although there is no information in silico which describes the action mechanisms at the molecular level. In this study, the inverse docking method was used to identify the interactions of PSK and PSP with two local databases: BPAT with 66 antitumor proteins, and BPSIC with 138 surfaces and intracellular proteins. This led to the identification interactions and similarities of PSK and the AB680 inhibitor in the active site of CD73. It was also found that PSK binds to CD59, interacting with the amino acids APS22 and PHE23, which coincide with the rlLYd4 internalization inhibitor. With the isoform of the K-RAS protein, PSK bonded to the TYR32 amino acid at switch 1, while with BAK it bonded to the region of the α1 helix, while PSP bonded to the activation site and the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of that helix. In Bcl-2, PSK interacted at the binding site of the Venetoclax inhibitor, showing similarities with the amino acids ASP111, VAL133, LEU137, MET115, PHE112, and TYR108, while PSP had similarities with THR132, VAL133, LEU137, GLN118, MET115, APS111, PHE112, and PHE104.
Various factors, such as helical propensity and hydrogen bonds, control protein structures. A frequently used model protein, myoglobin (Mb), can perform 3D domain swapping, in which the loop at the hinge region is converted to a helical structure in the dimer. We have previously succeeded in obtaining monomer-dimer equilibrium in the native state by introducing a high α-helical propensity residue, Ala, to the hinge region. In this study, we focused on another factor that governs the protein structure, hydrogen bonding. X-ray crystal structures and thermodynamic studies showed that the myoglobin dimer was stabilized over the monomer when keeping His82 to interact with Lys79 and Asp141 through water moleclues and mutating Leu137, which was located close to the H-bond network at the dimer hinge region, to a hydrophilic amino acid (Glu or Asp). Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed that the number of H-bonds increased and the α-helices at the hinge region became more rigid for mutants with a tighter H-bond network, supporting the hypothesis that the myoglobin dimer is stabilized when the H-bond network at the hinge region is enhanced. This demonstrates the importance and utility of hydrogen bonds for designing a protein dimer from its monomer with 3D domain swapping.
Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has attracted much attention due to its ability to catalyze the synthesis of important chiral alcohol pharmaceutical intermediates with high stereoselectivity. ADH protein engineering efforts have generally focused on reshaping the substrate-binding pocket. However, distant sites outside the pocket may also affect its activity, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. The current study aimed to apply evolutionary coupling-inspired engineering to the ADH CpRCR and to identify potential mutation sites. Through conservative analysis, phylogenic analysis and residues distribution analysis, the co-evolution hotspots Leu34 and Leu137 were confirmed to be highly evolved under the pressure of natural selection and to be possibly related to the catalytic function of the protein. Hence, Leu34 and Leu137, far away from the active center, were selected for mutation. The generated CpRCR-L34A and CpRCR-L137V variants showed high stereoselectivity and 1.24-7.81 fold increase in k cat /K m value compared with that of the wild type, when reacted with 8 aromatic ketones or β-ketoesters. Corresponding computational study implied that L34 and L137 may extend allosteric fluctuation in the protein structure from the distal mutational site to the active site. Moreover, the L34 and L137 mutations modified the pre-reaction state in multiple ways, in terms of position of the hydride with respect to the target carbonyl. These findings provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and facilitate its regulation from the perspective of the site interaction network.
Complicated ligand-dependent signaling pathways of bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues involve not only intranuclear estrogen receptor but also membrane receptor G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). However, the structural basis for molecular recognition of GPER by the environmental chemicals remains unknown. To reveal the structural dependence of GPER recognition by bisphenols, a systematic molecular dynamics simulation study was performed for selected bisphenols with different electron hybrid orbitals and substituents on their C atoms connecting two phenol rings. BPA was used as a control, bisphenol C(BPC) as an example for a connecting C with sp2 hybrid orbitals to provide more ligand rigidity, bisphenol E(BPE) and bisphenol F(BPF) for decreased steric hindrance and hydrophobicity around the connecting C, and bisphenol B(BPB) and bisphenol AF(BPAF) for increased hydrophobicity and steric hindrance. All the tested bisphenols can bind with GPER at its classic orthosteric site to obtain GPER-ligand complexes, while van der Waals interactions and direct inter-molecular electrostatic energies provide the driving forces for ligand binding. Bulky substituents and structural rigidity of the connecting C dramatically impair hydrogen bonding between GPER and the bisphenols, which results in decreased contribution of both favorable intermolecular hydrogen bonds and unfavorable polar solvation effect to complex stability of BPB and BPC since decreased number of key residues is expected. Increase in substituent lipophilicity enhances the van der Waals interactions and favorable non-polar solvation effect. The six bisphenols of high structural similarity shared two key recognition residues, Leu137TM3 and Trp272TM6, the latter of which was in the highly conserved CWxP motif of TM6 and has been reported as key residue for G protein-coupled receptor activation. Based on the obtained knowledge, GPER affinity and relevant toxicity of BPA alternatives can be easily predicted, and the calculated binding free energies are consistent with the available experimental observations.
The anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) are members of the Bcl-2 protein family, and they play important roles in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle retardation. However, the binding mechanisms of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 with their associated agonists, including Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), are not well understood. In the present study, the recently developed interaction entropy approach was employed for the calculation of entropic contribution, and the computational alanine scanning method was used to identify the hot spot in the protein-protein interactions between Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 and Bad/Bax. The calculated binding free energies and their ranks for the four systems were in good agreement with the experimental results. Computational analysis shows that there are more hot-spot residues in the Bcl-xL/Bad complex than that in the Bcl-xL/Bax complex, leading to a stronger binding affinity in the former. It is interesting to find that the reason for the stronger binding affinity of Bcl-2 to Bad than to Bax is different for the Bcl-xL system. Although there are more hot-spot residues in the Bcl-2/Bax system than in the Bcl-2/Bad complex, there are also more negatively contributing residues in the Bcl-2/Bax. Our study identified Arg104, Tyr105, Leu116, and Leu134 to be the common key residues in the Bcl-xL complexes, and Arg107, Tyr108, Phe112, Gln118, Leu137, Arg146, and Tyr202 are common key residues in the Bcl-2 complexes. These results would provide valuable information for the design of potent inhibitors of Bcl-xL/Bcl-2."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22391550/","A novel VIM-type metallo-β-lactamase variant, VIM-60, was identified in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates in Japan. Compared with VIM-2, VIM-60 had two amino acid substitutions (Arg228Leu and His252Arg) and higher catalytic activities against fourth-generation cephalosporins. The genetic context for blaVIM-60 was intI1-blaVIM-60-aadA1-aacA31-qacEdeltaI-sulI on the chromosome.
The metallo-β-lactamase VIM-31 differs from VIM-2 by only two Tyr224His and His252Arg substitutions. Located close to the active site, the Tyr224His substitution is also present in VIM-1, VIM-4, VIM-7 and VIM-12. The VIM-31 variant was reported in 2012 from Enterobacter cloacae and kinetically characterized. It exhibits globally lower catalytic efficiencies than VIM-2. In the present study, we report the three-dimensional structures of VIM-31 in its native (reduced) and oxidized forms. The so-called 'flapping-loop' (loop 1) and loop 3 of VIM-31 were not positioned as in VIM-2 but instead were closer to the active site as in VIM-4, resulting in a narrower active site in VIM-31. Also, the presence of His224 in VIM-31 disrupts hydrogen-bonding networks close to the active site. Moreover, a third zinc-binding site, which also exists in VIM-2 structures, could be identified as a structural explanation for the decreased activity of VIM-MBLs at high zinc concentrations.
We report the first description of the metallo-β-lactamase VIM-31, a new variant of VIM-2 with Tyr224His and His252Arg mutations, in Enterobacter cloacae 11236, which was isolated from blood specimens of a patient with colonic adenocarcinoma in Belgium. bla(VIM-31) was found on a class 1 integron located on a self-transferable but not typeable 42-kb plasmid. Compared to values published elsewhere for VIM-2, the purified VIM-31 enzyme showed weaker catalytic efficiency against all the tested beta-lactam agents (except for ertapenem), resulting from lower k(cat) (except for ertapenem) and higher K(m) values for VIM-31."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28655759/","Plasminogen (Plg), the zymogen of plasmin (Plm), is a glycoprotein involved in fibrinolysis and a wide variety of other physiological processes. Plg dysregulation has been implicated in a range of diseases. Classically, human Plg is categorized into two types, supposedly having different functional features, based on the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of a single N-linked glycan. Using high-resolution native mass spectrometry, we uncovered that the proteoform profiles of human Plg (and Plm) are substantially more extensive than this simple binary classification. In samples derived from human plasma, we identified up to 14 distinct proteoforms of Plg, including a novel highly stoichiometric phosphorylation site at Ser339. To elucidate the potential functional effects of these post-translational modifications, we performed proteoform-resolved kinetic analyses of the Plg-to-Plm conversion using several canonical activators. This conversion is thought to involve at least two independent cleavage events: one to remove the N-terminal peptide and another to release the active catalytic site. Our analyses reveal that these processes are not independent but are instead tightly regulated and occur in a step-wise manner. Notably, N-terminal cleavage at the canonical site (Lys77) does not occur directly from intact Plg. Instead, an activation intermediate corresponding to cleavage at Arg68 is initially produced, which only then is further processed to the canonical Lys77 product. Based on our results, we propose a refined categorization for human Plg proteoforms. In addition, we reveal that the proteoform profile of human Plg is more extensive than that of rat Plg, which lacks, for instance, the here-described phosphorylation at Ser339.
Entamoeba histolytica is a cosmopolitan protozoan parasite that can produce infections in the intestine and some organs (liver, lungs, and brain), with worldwide prevalence. There are treatments against E. histolytica (antiparasitics), but as the drugs used in these treatments have presented some type of resistance and/or side effects, there are cases with complications of this disease. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new drugs aimed at a specific therapeutic target against this parasite. Here, we used the compound 5,5'-[(4-nitrophenyl)methylene]bis(6-hydroxy-2-mercapto-3-methyl-4(3H)-pyrimidinone) in the patenting process (called D4). D4 has a reported specific use against a glycolytic enzyme, the triosephosphate isomerase of Trichomonas vaginalis (TvTIM). We determined that D4 has an amoebicidal effect in in vitro cultures, with an IC50 value of 18.5 µM, and we proposed a specific site of interaction (Lys77, His110, Gln115, and Glu118) in the triosephosphate isomerase of E. histolytica (EhTIM). Furthermore, compound D4 has favorable experimental and theoretical toxicity results. Therefore, D4 should be further investigated as a potential drug against E. histolytica.
The remarkable power and specificity of enzyme catalysis rely on the dynamic alignment of the enzyme, substrates, and cofactors, yet the role of dynamics has usually been approached from the perspective of the protein. We have been using an underappreciated NMR technique, subtesla high-resolution field cycling 31P NMR relaxometry, to investigate the dynamics of the enzyme-bound substrates and cofactor on guanosine-5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR). GMPR forms two dead end, yet catalytically competent, complexes that mimic distinct steps in the catalytic cycle: E·IMP·NADP+ undergoes a partial hydride transfer reaction, while E·GMP·NADP+ undergoes a partial deamination reaction. A different cofactor conformation is required for each partial reaction. Here we report the effects of mutations designed to perturb cofactor conformation and ammonia binding with the goal of identifying the structural features that contribute to the distinct dynamic signatures of the hydride transfer and deamination complexes. These experiments suggest that Asp129 is a central cog in a dynamic network required for both hydride transfer and deamination. In contrast, Lys77 modulates the conformation and mobility of substrates and cofactors in a reaction-specific manner. Thr105 and Tyr318 are part of a deamination-specific dynamic network that includes the 2'-OH of GMP. These residues have comparatively little effect on the dynamic properties of the hydride transfer complex. These results further illustrate the potential of high-resolution field cycling NMR relaxometry for the investigation of ligand dynamics. In addition, exchange experiments indicate that NH3/NH4+ has a high affinity for the deamination complex but a low affinity for the hydride transfer complex, suggesting that the movement of ammonia may gate the cofactor conformational change. Collectively, these experiments reinforce the view that the enzyme, substrates, and cofactor are linked in intricate, reaction-specific, dynamic networks and demonstrate that distal portions of the substrates and cofactors are critical features in these networks.
Runella slithyformis HD-Pnk is the prototype of a family of dual 5' and 3' nucleic acid end-healing enzymes that phosphorylate 5'-OH termini and dephosphorylate 2',3'-cyclic-PO4, 3'-PO4, and 2'-PO4 ends. HD-Pnk is composed of an N-terminal HD phosphohydrolase module and a C-terminal P-loop polynucleotide kinase module. Here, we probed the phosphoesterase activity of HD-Pnk by querying its ability to hydrolyze non-nucleic acid phosphoester substrates and by conducting a mutational analysis of conserved amino acid constituents of the HD domain. We report that HD-Pnk catalyzes vigorous hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylphosphate (Km = 3.13 mM; kcat = 27.8 s-1) using copper as its metal cofactor. Mutagenesis identified Gln28, His33, His73, Asp74, Lys77, His94, His127, Asp162, and Arg166 as essential for p-nitrophenylphosphatase and DNA 3' phosphatase activities. Structural modeling places these residues at the active site, wherein His33, His73, Asp74, His94, and His127 are predicted to coordinate a binuclear metal complex and Lys77 and Arg166 engage the scissile phosphate. HD-Pnk homologs are distributed broadly (and exclusively) in bacteria, usually in a two-gene cluster with a putative ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligase (LIG). We speculate that HD-Pnk and LIG comprise the end-healing and end-sealing components of a bacterial nucleic acid repair pathway.IMPORTANCE 5'-end healing and 3'-end healing are key steps in nucleic acid break repair in which 5'-OH ends are phosphorylated by a polynucleotide kinase, and 3'-PO4 or 2',3'-cyclic-PO4 ends are hydrolyzed by a phosphoesterase to generate 5'-PO4 and 3'-OH termini needed for joining by DNA and RNA ligases. This study interrogates, biochemically and via mutagenesis, the phosphoesterase activity of Runella slithyformis HD-Pnk, a bifunctional bacterial 5'- and 3'-end-healing enzyme composed of HD phosphoesterase and P-loop kinase modules. HD-Pnk homologs are found in 129 bacterial genera from 11 phyla. In 123/129 instances, HD-Pnk is encoded in an operon-like gene cluster with a putative ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligase (LIG), suggesting that HD-Pnk and LIG are agents of a conserved bacterial nucleic acid repair pathway.
In eukaryotes, precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing removes non-coding intron sequences to produce mature mRNA. This removal is controlled in part by RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing decisions through interactions with the splicing machinery. RNA binding motif protein 25 (RBM25) is a putative splicing factor strongly conserved across eukaryotic lineages. However, the role of RBM25 in global splicing regulation and its cellular functions are unknown. Here we show that RBM25 is required for the viability of multiple human cell lines, suggesting that it could play a key role in pre-mRNA splicing. Indeed, transcriptome-wide analysis of splicing events demonstrated that RBM25 regulates a large fraction of alternatively spliced exons throughout the human genome. Moreover, proteomic analysis indicated that RBM25 interacts with components of the early spliceosome and regulators of alternative splicing. Previously, we identified an RBM25 species that is mono-methylated at lysine 77 (RBM25K77me1), and here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to show that RBM25K77me1 is abundant in multiple human cell lines. We also identified a region of RBM25 spanning Lys-77 that binds with high affinity to serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), a crucial protein in exon definition, but only when Lys-77 is unmethylated. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for RBM25 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and reveal a new potential mechanism for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing by lysine methylation of a splicing factor."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38146933/","Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression1-3. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal4,5. However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2-mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2-mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies.
This study examined two oleosins of 17 kDa and 15 kDa isolated from Yuzhi white sesame seeds through oil body extraction. The allergens were identified as oleosin H1 (Ses i 4) and oleosin L (Ses i 5) using SDS-PAGE, dot blot analysis, and LC-MS/MS. PCR analysis revealed high sequence homology for the oleosin proteins in the sesame seeds. Utilizing AlphaFold2, bioinformatics tools, and protein-protein docking, the structure and function of these oleosins were analyzed. Ten potential B cell epitope peptides were predicted and mapped onto the α-helix and random coil-dominated oleosome membrane conformation. IgE binding simulations identified key epitopes, B3 (FLTSGAFGL) and B4 (KRGVQEGTLY) for oleosin H1, and B8 (GGFGVAALSV) and B9 (DQLESAKTKL) for oleosin L. Mutational analysis highlighted Glu135, Phe102, Tyr128, Tyr139, Gly136, and Gly132 in oleosin H1, and Leu120, Lys119, and Leu113 in oleosin L as critical residues for binding stability, providing insights into the sensitization mechanism of these epitopes. The integration of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics in this study has contributed to a deeper understanding of the allergy properties of sesame oleosins.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a serious public health risk, and prevention and treatment efforts are urgently needed. Effective preventive and therapeutic programs for cardiovascular disease are still lacking, as the causes of CVD are varied and may be the result of a multifactorial combination. Mitophagy is a form of cell-selective autophagy, and there is increasing evidence that mitophagy is involved in cardioprotective processes. Recently, many studies have shown that FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) levels and phosphorylation status are highly associated with many diseases, including heart disease. Here, we review the structure and functions of FUNDC1 and the path-ways of its mediated mitophagy, and show that mitophagy can be effectively activated by dephosphorylation of Ser13 and Tyr18 sites, phosphorylation of Ser17 site and ubiquitination of Lys119 site in FUNDC1. By effectively activating or inhibiting excessive mitophagy, the quality of mitochondria can be effectively controlled. The main reason is that, on the one hand, improper clearance of mitochondria and accumulation of damaged mitochondria are avoided, and on the other hand, excessive mitophagy causing apoptosis is avoided, both serving to protect the heart. In addition, we explore the possible mechanisms by which FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy is involved in exercise preconditioning (EP) for cardioprotection. Finally, we also point out unresolved issues in FUNDC1 and its mediated mitophagy and give directions where further research may be needed.
Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is a key transcriptional regulator in development via modulating chromatin structure and catalyzing histone H2A ubiquitination at Lys119 (H2AK119ub1). H2AK119ub1 is one of the most abundant histone modifications in mammalian cells. However, the function of H2AK119ub1 in polycomb-mediated gene silencing remains debated. In this study, we reveal that H2AK119ub1 has two distinct roles in gene expression, through differentially modulating chromatin compaction mediated by canonical PRC1 and the linker histone H1. Interestingly, we find that H2AK119ub1 plays a positive role in transcription through interfering with the binding of canonical PRC1 to nucleosomes and therefore counteracting chromatin condensation. Conversely, we demonstrate that H2AK119ub1 facilitates H1-dependent chromatin condensation and enhances the silencing of developmental genes in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting that H1 may be one of several possible pathways for H2AK119ub1 in repressing transcription. These results provide insights and molecular mechanisms by which H2AK119ub1 differentially fine-tunes developmental gene expression.
ATG4B is a core protein and essential for cleaving precursor MAP1LC3/LC3 or deconjugating lipidated LC3-II to drive the formation of autophagosomes. The protein stability and activity of ATG4B regulated by post-translational modification (ubiquitination) will directly affect macroautophagy/autophagy. However, the mechanism involved in ATG4B ubiquitination is largely unclear. In this study, a new E3 ligase of ATG4B, UBE3C, was identified by mass spectra. UBE3C mainly assembles K33-branched ubiquitin chains on ATG4B at Lys119 without causing ATG4B degradation. In addition, the increased ubiquitination of ATG4B caused by UBE3C overexpression inhibits autophagy flux in both normal and starvation conditions, which might be due to the reduced activity of ATG4B and ATG4B-LC3 interaction. This reduction could be reversed once the lysine 119 of ATG4B was mutated to arginine. More important, under starvation conditions the interaction between ATG4B and UBE3C apparently decreased followed by the removal of the K33-branched ubiquitin chain of ATG4B. Thus, starvation-induced autophagy could be partially suppressed by an increased ubiquitination level of ATG4B. In conclusion, our research reveals a novel modification mode of ATG4B in which UBE3C can fine tune ATG4B activity by specific ubiquitination regulating autophagy without causing ATG4B degradation.Abbreviation: ATG: autophagy-related; Baf: bafilomycin A1; CBB: Coomassie Brilliant Blue; CM: complete medium; CQ: chloroquine; GFP: green fluorescent protein; HA-Ub: HA-tagged ubiquitin; IF: immunofluorescence; IP: immunoprecipitation; K: lysine; KO: knockout; K0: all K-to-R mutant; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MS: mass spectrometry; NC: negative control; R: arginine; WCL: whole cell lysate; WT: wild-type."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226197/","Marburg virus (MARV) is a lipid-enveloped negative sense single stranded RNA virus, which can cause a deadly hemorrhagic fever. MARV encodes seven proteins, including VP40 (mVP40), a matrix protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the host cell plasma membrane. VP40 traffics to the plasma membrane inner leaflet, where it assembles to facilitate the budding of viral particles. VP40 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several host proteins and lipids to complete the viral replication cycle, but many of these host interactions remain unknown or are poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of a hydrophobic loop region in the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of mVP40 that shares sequence similarity with the CTD of Ebola virus VP40 (eVP40). These conserved hydrophobic residues in eVP40 have been previously shown to be critical to plasma membrane localization and membrane insertion. An array of cellular experiments and confirmatory in vitro work strongly suggests proper orientation and hydrophobic residues (Phe281, Leu283, and Phe286) in the mVP40 CTD are critical to plasma membrane localization. In line with the different functions proposed for eVP40 and mVP40 CTD hydrophobic residues, molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate large flexibility of residues in the EBOV CTD whereas conserved mVP40 hydrophobic residues are more restricted in their flexibility. This study sheds further light on important amino acids and structural features in mVP40 required for its plasma membrane localization as well as differences in the functional role of CTD amino acids in eVP40 and mVP40.
The colorectal cancer harbor germline, somatic or epimutations in mismatch repair genes, MUTYH or POLE gene, which lead to the hypermutated and ultramutator phenotypes with increased immune response. The mutations in POLE gene were reported to occur more frequently in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), and the patients are strong candidates for checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Here, we report mutation analysis within the endonuclease domain of the POLE gene in the cohort of patients with EOCRC in order to identify recurrent or new mutations and evaluate their association with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peritumoral lymphoid reaction. We have shown a significant association between MSI tumors and TILs (p = 0.004). Using sensitive single-tube nested PCR with subsequent Sanger sequencing, we have found in one female patient diagnosed at age 48 with rectal adenocarcinoma with mucinous elements staged pT3pN2pM1 a silent variant within the exon 9 NM_006231.3 c.849 C > T, NP_00622.2 p.Leu283 = recorded in dSNP as rs1232888774 with MAF = 0.00002. In silico prediction, result showed possible involvement into splicing; therefore, this rare variant can be involved into EOCRC pathogenesis. In the time of precise medicine, it is important to develop screening strategies also for less common conditions such as EOCRC allowing to predict tailored therapy for younger patients suffering from CRC that harbor mutations in the POLE gene.
Cysteine protease 1 precursor from Zea mays (zmCP1) is classified as a member of the C1A family of peptidases (papain-like cysteine protease) in MEROPS (the Peptidase Database). The 3D structure and substrate specificity of the zmCP1 is still unknown. This study is the first one to build the 3D structure of zmCP1 by computer-assisted homology modeling. In order to determine the substrate specificity of zmCP1, docking study is used for rapid and convenient analysis of large populations of ligand-enzyme complexes. Docking results show that zmCP1 has preference for P1 position and P2 position for Arg and a large hydrophobic residue (such as Phe). Gly147, Gly191, Cys189, and Asp190 are predicted to function as active residues at the S1 subsite, and the S2 subsite contains Leu283, Leu193, Ala259, Met194, and Ala286. SIFt results indicate that Gly144, Arg268, Trp308, and Ser311 play important roles in substrate binding. Then Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method was used to explain the substrate specificity for P1 position of zmCp1. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of zmCP1 activity and substrate specificity.
Animal venoms contain a fascinating array of divergent peptide toxins that have cross-activities on different types of voltage-gated ion channels. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Jingzhaotoxin-III (JZTX-III), a 36-residue peptide from the tarantula Chilobrachys jingzhao, is specific for Nav1.5 and Kv2.1 channels over the majority of other ion channel subtypes. JZTX-III traps the Nav1.5 DII voltage sensor at closed state by binding to the DIIS3-S4 linker. In this study, electrophysiological experiments showed that JZTX-III had no effect on five voltage-gated potassium channel subtypes (Kv1.4, Kv3.1, and Kv4.1-4.3), whereas it significantly inhibited Kv2.1 with an IC50 of 0.71 ± 0.01 μM. Mutagenesis and modeling data suggested that JZTX-III docks at the Kv2.1 voltage-sensor paddle. Alanine replacement of Phe274, Lys280, Ser281, Leu283, Gln284, and Val288 could decrease JZTX-III affinity by 7-, 9-, 34-, 12-, 9-, and 7-fold, respectively. Among them, S281 is the most crucial determinant, and the substitution with Thr only slightly reduced toxin sensitivity. In contrast, a single conversion of Ser281 to Ala, Phe, Ile, Val, or Glu increased the IC50 value by >34-fold. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments indicated that the functional surface of JZTX-III bound to the Kv2.1 channel is composed of four hydrophobic residues (Trp8, Trp28, Trp30, and Val33) and three charged residues (Arg13, Lys15, and Glu34). The bioactive surfaces of JZTX-III interacting with Kv2.1 and Nav1.5 are only partially overlapping. These results strongly supported the hypothesis that animal toxins might use partially overlapping bioactive surfaces to target the voltage-sensor paddles of two different types of ion channels. Increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of toxins interacting with voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels may provide new molecular insights into the design of more potent ion channel inhibitors.
Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are inhibitors generated by lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment such as dilute acid hydrolysis that inhibit microbial growth and interfere with subsequent fermentation. It is possible to in situ detoxify these inhibitory compounds by aldehyde reductions using tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YOL151W (GRE2) is a commonly recognized up-regulated gene expressed under stress conditions that encodes reductase activities toward furfural and HMF using cofactor NADH. Applying a directed enzyme evolution approach, we altered the genetic code of GRE2 yielding two mutants with amino acid substitutions of Gln261 to Arg261 and Phe283 to Leu283; and Ile107 to Val107, Gln261 to Arg261, and Val285 to Asp285 for strain Y62-C11 and Y62-G6, respectively. Clones of these mutants showed faster growth rates and were able to establish viable cultures under 30 mM HMF challenges when compared with a wild type GRE2 clone when inoculated into synthetic medium containing this inhibitor. Compared with the wild type control, crude cell extracts of the two mutants showed 3- to 4-fold and 3- to 9-fold increased specific enzyme activity using NADH toward HMF and furfural reduction, respectively. While retaining its aldehyde reductase activities using the cofactor NADH, mutant Y62-G6 displayed significantly greater reductase activities using NADPH as the cofactor with 13- and 15-fold increase toward furfural and HMF, respectively, as measured by its partially purified protein. Using reverse engineering and site directed mutagenesis methods, we were able to confirm that the amino acid substitution of the Asp285 is responsible for the increased aldehyde reductase activities by utilizing the additional cofactor NADPH."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28632421/","TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channel 1 (TASK-1) is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues and plays a significant role in neural activity and anesthetic modulation, making it a crucial target for pharmaceutical research. The high conservation of binding site residues within the TASK family, particularly between TASK-1 and TASK-3, necessitates the development of selective inhibitors for TASK-1. In this study, we utilized a combination of structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD) approaches. Initially, several bisamide-centered molecules were designed using the program MolAICal, which is recognized for its ability to generate selective inhibitors containing bisamide segments, and conducted preliminary screening via molecular docking. Subsequently, 3D-QSAR models were developed for 56 bisamide derivatives targeting TASK-1 and TASK-3, with the models exhibiting robust predictive capabilities (TASK-1: Q2 = 0.61, R2pred = 0.84; TASK-3: Q2 = 0.60, R2pred = 0.71). Using these models, the candidate molecules were subjected to activity prediction and subsequent filtering. Ultimately, molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with free energy calculations, pinpointed two bisamide-core molecules with favorable ADMET properties as potential selective inhibitors for TASK-1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations revealed the critical role of the key residue Leu122 in conferring selectivity to bisamide compounds for TASK-1 channel proteins.
Pin1 (protein interacting with never-in-mitosis akinase-1) is a member of the family of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) that specifically recognize and isomerize substrates containing phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro sequences. Pin1 is involved in many cellular processes and plays a key role in the cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, cell metabolism, proliferation and differentiation, and its abnormalities lead to degenerative and neoplastic diseases. Pin1 is highly expressed in human cancers and promotes the development of tumors by activating multiple oncogenes and inactivating multiple tumor suppressor genes, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the binding mechanism and conformational relationship between benzimidazole Pin1 inhibitors and Pin1 proteins by molecular docking, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling, binding free energy calculations and decomposition, and molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations disclosed the most likely binding pose of benzimidazoles with the Pin1 protein. The results of 3D-QSAR modeling indicated that electrostatic fields, hydrophobic fields and hydrogen bonding play important roles in the binding process of inhibitors to proteins. The binding free energy calculations and energy decomposition indicated that Lys63, Arg69, Cys113, Leu122, Met130, and Ser154 may be key residues in the binding of benzimidazole-based inhibitors to the Pin1 protein. This study provides an important theoretical basis for the design and optimization of benzimidazole compounds.
Pin1 (protein interacting with never-in-mitosis akinase-1) is a member of the PPIase (peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase) family. It can interact with a variety of carcinogenic or tumor suppressive phosphorylated proteins. The interaction results in the conformational changes of target proteins, and ultimately regulates the activity of these proteins. These activity changes play a key role in tumorigenesis. Pin1 is an attractive target for cancer therapy due to its over-expression and/or activation in various types of cancer and the disorder of Proline directed phosphorylation. In this study, molecular docking, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the structure-activity relationship and binding mechanism of 45 thiazole-class Pin1 inhibitors. Molecular docking studies predict the binding mode and the interactions between the ligand and the receptor protein. The results of the 3 D-QSAR model show that electrostatic field, hydrophobic field and hydrogen bond play important roles in the binding process of inhibitors to protein. Molecular dynamics simulation results reveal that the complex of the ligand and the receptor protein are stable at 300 K. The binding free energy calculation and energy decomposition results show that His59, Cys113, Ser114, Ser115, Leu122, Met130, Gln131, Phe134, Ser154 and His157 may be the key to the inhibitor binding to Pin1 protein. This study provides an important theoretical basis for further development of the new Pin1 inhibitor design. These results can provide more useful information for our further drug design.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by complete or partial deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut0 enzymatic subtype or mut- enzymatic subtype, respectively); a defect in the transport or synthesis of its cofactor, adenosyl-cobalamin (cblA, cblB, or cblD-MMA); or deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. The cblA type of MMA is very rare in China. This study aimed to describe the biochemical, clinical, and genetic characteristics of two siblings in a Chinese family, suspected of having the cblA-type of MMA.
Three series of novel urushiol derivatives were designed by introducing a hydroxamic acid moiety into the tail of an alkyl side chain and substituents with differing electronic properties or steric bulk onto the benzene ring and alkyl side chain. The compounds' binding affinity toward HDAC8 was screened by Glide docking. The highest-scoring compounds were processed further with molecular docking, MD simulations, and binding free energy studies to analyze the binding modes and mechanisms. Ten compounds had Glide scores of -8.2 to -10.2, which revealed that introducing hydroxy, carbonyl, amino, or methyl ether groups into the alkyl side chain or addition of -F, -Cl, sulfonamide, benzamido, amino, or hydroxy substituents on the benzene ring could significantly increase binding affinity. Molecular docking studies revealed that zinc ion coordination, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions contributed to the high calculated binding affinities of these compounds toward HDAC8. MD simulations and binding free energy studies showed that all complexes possessed good stability, as characterized by low RMSDs, low RMSFs of residues, moderate hydrogen bonding and zinc ion coordination and low values of binding free energies. Hie147, Tyr121, Phe175, Hip110, Phe119, Tyr273, Lys21, Gly118, Gln230, Leu122, Gly269, and Gly107 contributed favorably to the binding; and Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions provided major contributions to the stability of these complexes. These results show the potential of urushiol derivatives as HDAC8 binding lead compounds, which have great therapeutic potential in the treatment of various malignancies, neurological disorders, and human parasitic diseases."

In our study, 62 Philadelphia positive (Ph+) CML patients showing conspicuous expression of BCR-ABL gene were treated with imatinib. At the end of 3 months, 21/62 (33.87%) patients did not obtain complete hematological response (CHR) and also showed no significant decrease in BCR-ABL gene expression. In all the imatinib-resistant patients BCR-ABL gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed four novel missense mutations p.(Leu301Ile), p.(Tyr320His), p.(Glu373Asp), p.(Asp381Asn) and six already reported mutations p.(Val256Gly), p.(Thr315Ile), p.(Gly250Glu), p.(Tyr253His), p.(Phe317Leu), p.(Met351Thr) which contributed in the formation of inactive enzyme and also two novel frameshift mutations p.(Glu281*) and p.(Tyr393*), which resulted in truncated protein formation. Further, the structural analysis revealed all these mutations affected P-loop, gatekeeper, catalytic and activation loop domain regions of the enzyme causing poor imatinib binding in the ATP region. The primary intention of the study was to find out the mutations in the BCR-ABL gene causing imatinib resistance. This study highlights the need for BCR-ABL gene sequence analysis to detect the mutations in CML patients in order to properly guide the therapy."

CPV-2 has evolved, generating antigenic variants CPV-2a/2b/2c that are globally distributed. However, investigating molecular characterization of CPV-2 among dog populations in Mongolia has been limited. Herein, 42 stool samples were collected from dogs with clinical signs of infection, and conventional PCR assays were employed to detect CPV-2 in 23. Our results indicated that during 2016-2018, the new CPV-2a and 2c subtypes were detected in 34.7% of the samples, and the new CPV-2b subtype was detected in 30.4% of samples. VP2 protein sequence analysis and next-generation sequencing of the complete viral genome confirmed these antigenic types. However, sequence analysis indicated new and unreported mutations, Pro580Thr, and Tyr584His in the CPV-2c subtype. From a PCR-positive sample, CPV-2c was successfully isolated, and we performed an immunofluorescence assay for antigen detection. Additionally, we performed genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis to investigate genetic diversity among isolates from the region, resulting in high CPV-2 genetic diversity in the Mongolian dog population. Striking similarities were also observed between sequences of the strains isolated from Mongolia and China over a similar time span."

Diagnosis is established with the identification of various neurocutaneous symptoms and multiple organ system hamartomas. The authors report on a 9-year-old patient with episodes of vertigo and headache followed by full spontaneous recovery. There was no history of seizures, mental retardation, or other neurologic sequelae, and psychomotor development was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed pial angiomatosis of the left cerebellum and calcifications in the left parieto-occipital lobe consistent with the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. At the age of 13, multiple renal angiomyolipomas and a single hypomelanotic macule were found, and subsequent imaging revealed several cortical tuberi. The diagnosis was confirmed by sequence analysis, which identified a novel missense mutation p.Ala460Thr in exon 13 of the TSC2 gene. Thus, mild tuberous sclerosis due to a hypomorphic mutation in TSC2 may present with isolated leptomeningeal angiomatosis."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32010610/","We evaluated the genetic diversity of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of pertussis, within households by whole-genome sequencing. In pairwise comparisons of 23 isolates collected from 11 households, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed extremely low SNP diversity (≤1 SNP) between isolate pairs: no SNPs were detected in 10 households and one SNP was obtained in the remaining household. This SNP was uncommon for B. pertussis and resulted in a nonsynonymous substitution (Ala303Thr) in nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase. We demonstrated that the same strain is transmitted between household members and that B. pertussis is genomically stable during household transmission.
The aim of the following case report is to provide a description of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a patient with Netherton syndrome (NS). A 15-year-old male with NS was referred with suspicion of acute leukemia. Severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CRP level were demonstrated in pre-hospital laboratory tests. Physical examination revealed generalized ichthyosiform erythroderma. ALL was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow biopsy. The patient was initially classified as CNS3 status. No signals indicating fusion of BCR/ABL1, ETV6, and RUNX1 genes and MLL gene rearrangement were found in the cytogenetic analysis. The patient was qualified for chemotherapy and treated according to ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol for high-risk ALL. During induction therapy, severe skin toxicity occurred (WHO grade III), which prompted the modification of treatment down to intermediate-risk strategy. In the course of reinduction therapy, severe chemotherapy-induced adverse drug reactions occurred, including progression of skin toxicity to WHO grade IV. The patient achieved complete remission. In view of life-threatening toxicities and the confirmed complete remission, intensive chemotherapy regimen was discontinued and maintenance treatment was started. Because of the baseline CNS3 status, the patient received cranial radiotherapy. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify disease-associated mutations. WES revealed two germline mutations: a novel premature termination variant in SPINK5 (p.Cys510*), along with a novel potentially pathogenic variant in NUP214 (p.Arg815Gln). Somatic mutations were known pathogenic variants of JAK2 (p.Arg683Gly), IL17RC (p.Ala303Thr), and potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants of TTN (p.Gly1091Arg and p.Pro17245Leu), ACTN2 (p.Ile143Leu), TRPV3 (p.Arg729*), and COL7A1 (p.Glu2842fs) genes. Currently, the patient continues maintenance chemotherapy, with stable status of skin lesions and no features of ALL relapse. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ALL in a patient with NS. As has been presented, in such patients, optimal treatment according to the current protocols is extremely difficult. WES was used to confirm the diagnosis of Ph-like ALL in our patient. The detection of JAK2 gene mutation offers the possibility of therapy personalization. A specific signature of rare germline variants and somatic mutations can be proposed as a factor predisposing to the co-incidence of ALL and NS."
